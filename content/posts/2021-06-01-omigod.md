# OMIGOD

<br/>

<br/>
Azure forces the install of an agent on Linux VMs, which contained a vulnerability that would grant root RCE if an attacker could send a web request to them. Initially, Microsoft did not update the agent automatically, and so customers had to patch manually, but a few days later they began patching some services remotely.
