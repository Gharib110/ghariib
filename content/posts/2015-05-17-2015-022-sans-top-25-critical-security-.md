# 2015-022 SANS Top 25 Critical Security Controls-10 and 11

<br/>

<br/>
When you're working with network infrastructure, there's a real need for proper configuration management, as well as having a proper baseline to work from.

Mr. Boettcher and I continue through the SANS Top25 Critical Security Controls. #10 and #11 are all dealing with network infrastructure. Proper patches, baselines for being as secure as possible. Since your company's ideal security structure needs to be a 'brick', and not an 'egg'.
