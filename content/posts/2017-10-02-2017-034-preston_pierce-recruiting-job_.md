# 2017-034-Preston_Pierce recruiting job_descriptions

<br/>

<br/>
\*Apologies for the continuity this was recorded before we went to Derbycon 2017.\*

Preston Pierce is a recruiter. We wanted to have him on to discuss some issues with our industry. So we had him on to discuss hiring practices, how a recruiter can help a company recruiter better talent, and how to stop companies looking for the 'unicorn' candidate.

Preston is a great guy and we learned a lot about how the recruiting process works, and how Preston's company work differently from other, less reputable companies.

We also discuss job descriptions, getting management buy in for a good candidate, and more.

**Blueteamers**

Looking at job descriptions,

Fix if outdated or unnecessary

**Managers**

Be realistic about expectations

**Recruiters**

Better research of people

Discuss realistic demands from customers

**You**

Update your LinkedIn removing overly generalized terms (healthcare, for example)

When should you reach out to a recruiter? Right away? After you’ve already completed some leg work?

Companies do a poor job of marketing for their current openings.
