		<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s March update fixes as many as half-a-dozen vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by attackers.</p>
<p>In its monthly <em>Patch Tuesday</em> update, Microsoft has provided patches for six vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in the wild. Four of these vulnerabilities are related to file systems — three of which having the same trigger, which may indicate that they’re being used in one and the same attack, or at least by the same actor. The details of their exploitation are still publicly undisclosed (fortunately), but the latest update is highly recommended for immediate installation.</p>

<p>According to Sophos, ransomware recovery costs soared to $2.73 million in 2024, displaying a 500% rise compared to 2023 and underscoring the escalating financial toll of cyberattacks. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC have recently issued a joint advisory on Medusa ransomware, which has impacted over 300 victims across critical infrastructure sectors as of February 2025. Notably, Medusa ransomware is distinct from MedusaLocker and Medusa mobile malware iteration as per the research.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The endpoint security market is at a critical inflection point. While cyberthreats are evolving at an unprecedented pace, accelerated by artificial intelligence and automated attack tools, many traditional endpoint security solutions are struggling to keep up, leaving organizations vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. As we analyze the results from the December 2024 MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation, a clear pattern emerges: Palo Alto Networks has established itself as one of the top three endpoint security solutions through years of demonstrated excellence and innovation.</p>

		<p>This ExecBrief helps organizations understand and address the various cyber risks that can stem from mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>The post PinnacleOne ExecBrief | The Hidden Cyber Risks of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions appeared first on SentinelOne.</p>
<p>It’s been over a year since news of a ransomware attack on Change Healthcare’s systems shook the healthcare industry. The Energy and Commerce House Committee’s investigation found that, given Change Healthcare’s position as one of the largest health payment processing companies, the attack threatened patients’ access to care by creating a backlog of unpaid claims and hospital cashflow issues. Over 190 million patients’ health care data was stolen.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Organizations are increasingly turning to Kubernetes to orchestrate their containerized applications. However, many enterprises face unique challenges that cloud-based Kubernetes solutions cannot fully address. These challenges include leveraging existing bare metal infrastructure, ensuring data sovereignty, optimizing costs, and maintaining granular control over their environments. By deploying Kubernetes on bare metal, companies can achieve greater infrastructure flexibility, meet compliance requirements, and optimize performance for resource-intensive workloads.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal infrastructure using AWS EKS-Anywhere. But before we start using self-hosted Kubernetes, it’s crucial to understand the key differences between managed and self-hosted solutions and where AWS EKS-Anywhere fits in.</p>
