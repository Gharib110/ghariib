# The IPv6 Transition

<br/>

<br/>
I wrote an article in May 2022, asking “Are we there yet?” about the transition to IPv6. At the time I concluded the article on an optimistic note, observing that we may not be ending the transition just yet, but we are closing in. I thought at the time that we won’t reach the end of this transition to IPv6 with a bang, but with a whimper. A couple of years later, I’d like to revise these conclusions with some different thoughts about where we are heading and why.
