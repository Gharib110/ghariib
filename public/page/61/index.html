<p>With the release of iOS 17.3, Apple introduced a new security feature called “Stolen Device Protection.” This functionality is designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data in cases where a thief has gained knowledge of an iPhone’s passcode. While this feature significantly enhances security for end users, it simultaneously creates substantial obstacles for digital forensic experts, complicating lawful data extraction.</p>
<h2 id="a-roadblock-to-logical-extraction">A Roadblock to Logical Extraction</h2>
<p>Gaining access to data on Apple devices has historically been most feasible through standard mechanisms leveraged by many forensic tools, including iOS Forensic Toolkit, as part of an advanced logical extraction process. Alternative methods, such as low-level extraction, are either limited to older devices and iOS versions (currently, iOS 16.6.1 is the latest iOS build supported by iOS Forensic Toolkit) or legacy devices. Cloud-based analysis also presents challenges, as it requires full user credentials, and the device passcode is required on top of that to access end-to-end encrypted data.</p>

<p>Open source projects generally begin with a problem to be solved. If it’s a problem a lot of people have, it may gain traction. Eventually you might have many people contributing. Before you know it, your project might turn into more than just a project, but a community.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment grows, you might develop a need to grant cross-account access to resources. This could be for various reasons, such as enabling centralized operations across multiple AWS accounts, sharing resources across teams or projects within your organization, or integrating with third-party services. However, granting cross-account access requires careful consideration of your security, availability, and manageability requirements.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explore four different ways to grant cross-account access using resource-based policies. Each method has its own unique tradeoffs, and the best choice depends on your specific requirements and use case.</p>

		<p>At Tuta, we are deeply concerned about the proposed amendment to the so-called &ldquo;Narcotrafic&rdquo; law, which would force encrypted communication providers to implement backdoors for law enforcement. This would threaten everybody’s security and privacy and could be in conflict with European data protection legislation and Germany&rsquo;s IT Security Act. We urge the French National Assembly to reject this dangerous amendment. A backdoor for the good guys only is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>March 6, 2025:</strong> We’ve updated this post to clarify that generated domain reports contain only HTTP and HTTPS traffic domain log data collected from the moment traffic analysis mode is enabled, with a maximum of 30 days.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When it comes to controlling incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) network traffic, organizations typically focus heavily on inbound traffic controls—carefully restricting what traffic can enter their network perimeter. However, this approach addresses only inbound security challenges. Modern applications rely heavily on third-party code through operating systems, libraries, and packages. This dependency can create potential security vulnerabilities. If these components are compromised, affected workloads might attempt to connect to unauthorized command and control servers or send sensitive data to unauthorized destinations on the internet.</p>

<p>For most of history, the world got along fine without the rare earth elements. We knew they existed, we knew they weren’t really all that rare, and we really didn’t have much use for them — until we discovered just how useful they are and made ourselves absolutely dependent on them, to the point where not having them would literally grind the world to a halt.</p>
<p>This dependency has spurred a search for caches of rare earth elements in the strangest of places, from muddy sediments on the sea floor to asteroids. But there’s one potential source that’s much closer to home: coal ash waste. According to a study from the University of Texas Austin, the 5 gigatonnes of coal ash produced in the United States between 1950 and 2021 might contain as much as $8.4 billion worth of REEYSc — that’s the 16 lanthanide rare earth elements plus yttrium and scandium, transition metals that aren’t strictly rare earths but are geologically associated with them and useful in many of the same ways.</p>

		<p>Treating exposures as full and complete can help you respond more effectively to focus on what truly matters: securing systems, protecting sensitive data, and maintaining the trust of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The post Full exposure: A practical approach to handling sensitive data leaks appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p><em>This post originally appeared in Infosecurity Magazine, and is republished here with permission.</em></p>
<p>In the fast-paced world of software development, accidents can happen—even to the best of us. One such unfortunate event is the accidental leakage of sensitive data such as private or internal source code. When this occurs, companies often find themselves in a frantic rush to assess the situation, leading them down the rabbit hole of trying to determine just how exposed their sensitive data really is. However, this quest for degrees of exposure is a futile endeavor. There’s no such thing as “just a little bit exposed.” Instead, it’s better to opt for the more pragmatic approach: treat the exposure as full and complete from the moment it happens.</p>
