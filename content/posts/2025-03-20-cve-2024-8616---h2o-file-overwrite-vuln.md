# CVE-2024-8616 - H2O File Overwrite Vulnerability

<br/>

<br/>
**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-8616  
**Published :** March 20, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 12 minutes ago  
**Description :** In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0, the \`/99/Models/{name}/json\` endpoint allows for arbitrary file overwrite on the target server. The vulnerability arises from the \`exportModelDetails\` function in \`ModelsHandler.java\`, where the user-controllable \`mexport.dir\` parameter is used to specify the file path for writing model details. This can lead to overwriting files at arbitrary locations on the host system.  
**Severity:** 8.2 | HIGH
