# DNS Nameservers

<br/>

<br/>
It's common folklore in the Domain Name System that a delegated domain name must be served by 2 or more nameservers. This guidance raises a couple of questions. Firstly, when presented with a list of nameservers for a domain how do recursive resolvers respond? Do they send queries to all of the nameservers at once? Or do they serialise their actions in looking for a responsive nameserver? Secondly, if these queries are serialised, then how can a domain administrator organise the zoneâ€™s nameservers to maximise both DNS resolution performance and service resilience?
