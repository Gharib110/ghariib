		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) successfully completed an onboarding audit with no findings for ISO 9001:2015, 27001:2022, 27017:2015, 27018:2019, 27701:2019, 20000-1:2018, and 22301:2019, and Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) v4.0. EY CertifyPoint auditors conducted the audit and reissued the certificates on February 19, 2025. The objective was to assess the level of compliance with the requirements of the applicable international standards.</p>
<p>We’ve added four additional AWS services to the audit scope since the last certification issued on November 29, 2024. These are the four additional services:</p>

<p>Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 today released its 2025 Global Incident Response Report, revealing that 86% of major cyber incidents in 2024 resulted in operational downtime, reputational damage or financial loss. The report (based on 500 major cyber incidents that Unit 42 responded to across 38 countries and every major industry) highlights a new trend: financially motivated attackers have shifted their focus to deliberate operational disruption, prioritizing sabotage – destroying systems, locking customers out and causing prolonged downtime – to maximize impact and pressure organizations into paying extortion demands.</p>

<p>SecureAcademy recently hosted its first-ever Global Cyber Range Challenge, a virtual event designed to provide cyber security students and enthusiasts with real-world, hands-on experience. With participants from 11 countries and 12 academic institutions, the event showcased the power of immersive learning using one of Cyber Park’s gamified experiences to prepare the next generation of cyber defenders. These experiences include Red Team-Blue Team, CTF-style cyber ranges, and introductory escape rooms. The cyber ranges serve as a “flight simulator” for cyber security professionals, providing a gamified, lifelike environment to test and refine their skills.

		<p>Buying a new gaming monitor feels pointless to me</p>
<p>When you hear the term PC upgrades, what do you imagine? — probably a GPU, CPU, SSD, RAM, or motherboard (in that order). At least, that&rsquo;s how I think about PC upgrades. Although I haven&rsquo;t made any major upgrades to my PC in almost 3 years, I never thought about upgrading my monitor in all that time. My existing monitor is an LG 27GL850, a 27&quot; 1440p 144Hz IPS display that I purchased back in 2021.</p>

		<p>Hello friends! Today, we will learn how to put Minikube on your Ubuntu computer. Minikube is a tool that runs Kubernetes, a very popular thing for managing apps, on your own machine. It’s easy to do, and I’ll show you everything step by step. We will also need kubectl (a command tool for Kubernetes) and Docker (a tool to run containers). Don’t worry, I’ll explain it all in simple words like we’re chatting!</p>

	<div>
		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Apache Tomcat, which could allow for remote code execution. Apache Tomcat is an open-source Java servlet container and web server used to host Java-based web applications and implement Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications, providing a platform for running dynamic web content. Successful exploitation of the of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.</p>
