_Winter Break Of Code, Day Fifteen_

The 1988 film [_They Live_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is one of the last great masterpieces to [come out of the Hollywood left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18qD9hmU9xg). In the film, a drifter named John Nada discovers a box of sunglasses that, when worn, allows the wearer to really _see_ the world around him.

For instance, when wearing the glasses, simple advertisements for consumer products are revealed as something other than what they appear.
