# 2015-037-making patch management work

<br/>

<br/>
Once you find a vulnerability, how do you handle patching it? Especially when devs have their own work to do, there are only so many man hours in a sprint or development cycle, and the patching process could take up a good majority of that if the vuln is particularly nasty.

One method is to triage your patches, and we discuss that this week with Mr. Boettcher. We also talk about how our respective company's handle patching of systems.

We also discuss what happens when compensating controls run out of effectiveness, and if there is a point at which they no longer are 'compensating' for anything any further.
