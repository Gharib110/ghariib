# What is Preemptive Cyber Defense and Why Are Security Leaders Adopting This New Approach

<br/>

<br/>
Faced with an ever-evolving threat landscape that demands time and resources to understand and overcome, security leaders across a range of industries and sectors are on the constant look-out for new solutions to the age-old problem of how to stop breaches. Enter stage right Preemptive Cyber Defense (PCD): a relatively new cybersecurity strategy that seeks to proactively stop attacks and potential threats as they emerge – rather than after they’ve been launched – and improve overall security performance.

2024 Gartner® report into Preemptive Cyber Defense adoption trends  
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This blog references a recent Gartner report entitled ‘Emerging Tech: Adoption Trends in Preemptive Cyber Defense’.1

In the report, Gartner perform a deep dive into how organizations view the growing field of Preemptive Cyber Defense, the value of this new approach, and what to expect in the near term. 

Current projections indicate a substantial increase in the adoption rate of Preemptive Cyber Defense solutions from 5% to 35% by 2028, as organizations attempt to “leverage proactive mechanisms of defense, predictive intelligence or attack anticipation, instead of focusing on detection and response”.2

Preemptive threat intelligence as part of a Preemptive Cyber Defense strategy 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ve recently [explored the concept of preemptive threat intelligence](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/preemptive-threat-intelligence/) by explaining how little of global threat infrastructure is known at any one time, and how Silent Push helps organizations to reveal it using Indicators of Future Attack (IOFAs), 

The data used in preemptive threat intelligence provides teams with the ability to proactively respond to threats and reveal known and hidden attacker infrastructure, using a Preemptive Cyber Defense-led approach. 

Let’s look at some of the primary outcomes of a well-executed Preemptive Cyber Defense strategy that incorporates preemptive threat intelligence, and how Silent Push can help you to achieve them. 

1\. Rapid identification and mitigation of threats 
---------------------------------------------------

Gartner cite quick, reliable threat identification and mitigation as a prime concern for businesses with a range of risk profiles and regulatory obligations. 

Sectors such as Finance and Healthcare are considered high value targets by threat actors due to the sheer volume of highly sensitive data being processed, and how lucrative that data becomes in the event of a breach.3 

Both of these sectors lead the PCD adoption curve, and derive a huge amount of value from operating with a cybersecurity strategy that doesn’t sit around and wait for an attack to occur before mitigating any damage, but instead proactively identifies vulnerabilities and new ransomware-based attack vectors so that data is protected around the clock, and the chances of a breach are kept to a minimum.4 

Government and Technology organizations however, according to Gartner, have considerable “room for improvement” when it comes to proactive threat detection.5

We believe that Silent Push can help security teams execute a PCD-led approach to cyber defense, in any industry, to assist in meeting operational priorities. 

In our opinion, no other vendor knows more about the distribution of global threat infrastructure than Silent Push, and no other vendor is capable of tracking the large amount of domains and IPs that usually go unnoticed during an attack, before they’re used against you, so that you stay one step ahead of the bad guys and know precisely where the next attack could be coming from. 

2\. Increased threat visibility 
--------------------------------

The Gartner report highlights a persistent “lack of visibility” within modern cyber defenses that do not provide full coverage of an attack, and gives adversaries more time to probe for weaknesses, especially in hidden corners of an external attack surface.6

Once this “critical challenge” is overcome by utilizing preemptive intelligence data that maps out both internal and external datapoints in full, organizations increase their ability to detect threats quicker than a traditional IOC-led approach allows, and can take steps to block attacks at source before they cause a problem.7 

Silent Push helps security teams clear the fog and break through the visibility barrier, by providing a complete view of any given threat landscape and attack surface, that provides a huge amount of insight into where the next attack could be coming from. 

We achieve this by giving teams the ability to input an unknown indicator and gain an immediate appraisal of how a domain or IP address related to the rest of the internet, including how it’s hosted, what other infrastructure it’s similar to, how it’s moved across the global IP space over time, and – crucially – how to respond. 

3\. Improved SecOps efficiency 
-------------------------------

According to Gartner, Preemptive Cyber Defense strategies allow teams to build “efficient operations that ensure security teams can focus on high-priority tasks, reducing the time and effort spent on routine or redundant activities” by utilizing predictive technology, detection techniques to instantly verify threat datapoints, and do away with endless pivots that may or may not end up with reliable intelligence on any given domain or IP. 

In the shift towards Preemptive Cyber Defense, organizations are benefitting from an approach that rapidly identifies threats and minimizes the potential damage caused by cyberattacks. Security teams that adopt this new approach are realizing significant improvements in the speed and effectiveness of cybersecurity workflows, including integrations.

At Silent Push, increased operational efficiency is at the forefront of what we provide to our customers. Our IOFA datasets give security teams all the context they need to quickly identify and understand unknown indicators, allowing them to make informed, timely decisions in high-pressure situations where every second counts. 

Why do we believe you should adopt a Preemptive Cyber Defense strategy using Silent Push? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you’re in Finance, Government, Healthcare, Retail, or any other industry that considers cybersecurity an important business function, Preemptive Cyber Defense is here to stay.7

The Gartner report concludes that “Enhancing SecOps efficiency is crucial for these industries’ ability to quickly adapt to evolving threats, streamline incident response, processes and reduce the mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond to security incidents”.

Silent Push is a preemptive cybersecurity vendor that provides Indicators of Future Attack (IOFA) – domain and IP datapoints that tell teams where an attack is coming **from**, as well as where it’s **been** – that form the basis of a well-executed Preemptive Cyber Defense strategy.

Our IOFAs are at the forefront of the Preemptive Cyber Defense revolution, providing insight into the vast amount of threat infrastructure that currently goes undetected by a traditional approach to cyber defense.
