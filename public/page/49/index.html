<p>Who We Are</p>
<p>We are a startup on a mission to disrupt Cryto, AWS &amp; Google Cloud with a decentralized, open-source cloud platform powered by Proof of Compute (PoC) instead of Proof of Work. Our vision? Turn idle computing power into a decentralized cloud where miners earn by contributing real compute resources.</p>
<p>What We‚Äôre Building</p>
<p>üîπ A global, distributed cloud that is cheaper, faster, and censorship-resistant</p>

		<p>Researching and reverse engineering Level 2 Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE or loosely ‚Äúcharger‚Äù) efforts might require the equipment to be placed beyond the idle state. The idle state is straightforward and usually involves nothing more than powering up the charger. Indeed, this is a very useful state for research where the user interface is in operation, communications both wired and wireless are working and the mobile device app can interact. However, there are times when there is a need to force the charger into other states so that it behaves as though the electric vehicle is attached, the EV is asking for charge, or the EV is charging and the EVSE is providing charging current. ¬†</p>

		<p>Washington, D.C.‚Äôs empty federal office buildings rank high among the most¬†visible¬†examples¬†of wasteful government spending. Where else can you find blocks of high-dollar real estate going virtually unused by the very bureaucrats for whom these buildings are supposed to be the nerve centers for their supposed vital functions?</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, you can find similar examples of federal government waste all across the country. Bureaucrats don‚Äôt just pay millions to not use their own buildings. They also pay millions in service contracts to outside organizations for facilities they don‚Äôt use either.</p>
