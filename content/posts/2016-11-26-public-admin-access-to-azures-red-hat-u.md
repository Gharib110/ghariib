# Public admin access to Azures Red Hat Update Infrastructure

<br/>

<br/>
Full administrative access to the Azure Red Hat Enterprise Linux Appliance REST API was publicly exposed. It allowed malicious actors uploading packages that would be acquired by client virtual machines on their next yum update. The vulnerable infrastructure supplies all the packages for all Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances booted from the Azure marketplace.
