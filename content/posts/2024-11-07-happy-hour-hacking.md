# Happy hour hacking

<br/>

<br/>
Maria Varmazis, host of N2K's daily space show T-Minus, joins Dave and Joe to share the story of the five types of social engineers Deanne Lewis encountered while tending bar, revealing how each barroom personality reflects a common cybersecurity threat. Our hosts share some follow-up from a friend of the show, JJ, who reports a rise in tech support scams targeting non-tech-savvy users by locking their screens and persuading them to call scammers, often leading to credit card fraud and unauthorized remote access through tools like AnyDesk or TeamViewer. Joe has two stories this week: one covering JPMorgan Chase's lawsuits against individuals who exploited an ATM glitch to withdraw fake deposits, a scam popularized on TikTok; and the second on four suspects in Maryland charged with conning an elderly woman out of nearly $40,000 in a "pigeon drop" scam, where victims are promised a cut of "found" money in exchange for collateral. Dave's story is on a viral AI-generated hoax spreading on Facebook, where fake posts about neighbors egging cars over Halloween decorations are stirring moral panic and sowing distrust, especially among older users. Finally, our catch of the day comes from some text threads about a scammer trying to get clever while buying a used car.
