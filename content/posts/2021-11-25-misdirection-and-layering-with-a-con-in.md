# Misdirection and layering with a con in the middle Hacking Humans Goes to the Movies

<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for joining us for our fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Co-hosts Dave Bittner and Joe Carrigan are joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave, Joe and Rick are watching Joe's and Rick's scene picks. They watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then the team deconstructs what they saw. Grab your popcorn and join us for a trip to the movies. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Joe's clip from "The Simpsons: Father and Son Grifting" episode Rick's pick from "Paper Moon"
