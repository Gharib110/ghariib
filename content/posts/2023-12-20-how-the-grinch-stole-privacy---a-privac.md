I also had the oppotunity to talk about this silly take with CBC Information Morning Halifax and Cape Breton. You can listen to the interviews here: [Halifax](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-27-information-morning-ns/clip/16030859-pleading-25th-david-fraser-legal-advice-favourite-christmas), [Cape Breton](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-24-information-morning-cape-breton/clip/16031138-a-legal-retainer-grinch?share=true).
