TALKING VICTIMIZATION 

An estimated 6-7.5 million people are #stalked in a one year period in the United States.   
Nearly 1 in 6 women and 1 in 17 men have experienced stalking victimization at some point in their lifetime.   
Using a less conservative definition of stalking, which considers any amount of fear (i.e., a little fearful, somewhat fearful, or very fearful), 1 in 4 women and 1 in 13 men reported being a victim of stalking in their lifetime.  
About half of all victims of stalking indicated that they were stalked before the age of 25.   
Stalkers use many tactics including:   
Approaching the victim or showing up in places when the victim didn’t want them to be there;   
making unwanted telephone calls; leaving the victim unwanted messages (text or voice);   
watching or following the victim from a distance  
spying on the victim with a listening device, camera, or #GPS.  (or #IOT device)

“Smart” or connected devices often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) turn up in cases “all the time” or “often” for a third of advocates and 1 in 5 #legal systems professionals. While this is rather low, people are increasingly using these types of technology. With additional use we may see increases in abuse through them. Additionally, advocates and legal systems professionals are often not aware of how these technologies can be misused, so they may not ask about them.
