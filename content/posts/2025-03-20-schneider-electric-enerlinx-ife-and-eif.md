4\. MITIGATIONS
---------------

Schneider Electric has identified the following specific remediations and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:

-   CVE-2025-0814: Version 004.010.000 of Enerlin'X IFE and eIFE includes a fix for this vulnerability. [Download the latest version of the EcoStruxure Power Commission tool available](https://www.se.com/ww/en/product-country-selector/?pageType=product-range&sourceId=62980#overview) to install the latest firmware version of the Enerlin'X IFE and eIFE.

Users should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. Schneider Electric strongly recommends the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a test and development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric's [Customer Care Center](https://www.se.com/us/en/work/support/) for assistance removing a patch.

If users choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

Enerlin'X IFE and eIFE: All versions ( CVE-2025-0815 and CVE-2025-0816) Users should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

-   Use devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from public Internet or untrusted networks.
-   Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access to ports supported by the product and listed in the [user guide.](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/DOCA0084EN/)
-   Configure the Access Control List following the recommendations of the \[Cybersecurity Guide\](  
    [https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/DOCA0122EN/](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/DOCA0122EN/) and the [user guide.](https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/DOCA0084EN/)
-   To ensure you are informed of all updates, including details on affected products and remediation plans, subscribe to [Schneider Electric's security notification service.](https://www.se.com/en/work/support/cybersecurity/security-notifications.jsp)

Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:

-   Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
-   Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.
-   Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the "Program" mode.
-   Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
-   Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
-   Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
-   Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
-   When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
