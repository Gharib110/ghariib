# PGP and GPG -- protect your data

<br/>

<br/>
Sharing information between people and organizations can be a sensitive issue, especially if the information being shared is of mutual importance. 

This week, we break down PGP and it's open source cousin GPG.  We discuss how last week's podcast about hashing, encoding, and encryption are all bundled up neatly with PGP, and give you some examples of software you can use on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
