# Calling All Potential Peak Performers

<br/>

<br/>
In our recent _Freakonomics Radio_ episode “[How to Become Great at Just About Anything](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/peak/)," we spoke with [**K. Anders Ericsson**](https://psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html), a research psychologist who has spent more than 30 years studying expert performers in many fields — music, sports, chess, surgery, teaching, writing, and more. Ericsson's recent book is called _[Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0544456238/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0544456238&linkCode=as2&tag=freakonomic08-20&linkId=Q22MVKHC3OFO7NAY)._ It has inspired us to try launching a _Freakonomics_ spinoff podcast, called (for now) _Peak_.
