Arriving early in Vegas? Check out Black Hat’s Arsenal and Business Hall for free!  
  
This year, we’ve partnered with our friends at Black Hat to offer a free Black Hat Business Pass to all Def Con In-Person Badge holders. The pass would normally cost $250, but if you fill out their form here, you can get in for free. You’ll just need to show your DEF CON confirmation receipt when you pick up you Black Hat Business Hall pass over at Mandalay Bay.  
  
Black Hat Business Hall hours:  
Wednesday, August 4, 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM
