# Stewart Baker and Max Schrems Debate the Privacy Framework

<br/>

<br/>
[Max Schrems](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-schrems/?originalSubdomain=at) is the lawyer and activist behind two (and, probably soon, a third) legal challenge to the adequacy of U.S. law to protect European personal data. Thanks to the [Federalist Society’s Regulatory Transparency Project,](https://rtp.fedsoc.org/) Max and I were able to spend an hour debating the law and policy behind Europe’s generation-long fight with the United States over transatlantic data flows.  It’s civil, pointed, occasionally raucous, and wide-ranging – a fun, detailed introduction to the issues that will almost certainly feature in the next round of litigation over the latest agreement between Europe and the U.S. Don’t miss it!
