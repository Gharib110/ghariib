Here at the DEF CON Research Institute, we’ve been working hard to unlock the perfect blend of mind-expanding content and sweaty dancefloor abandon that makes the perfect Con experience. You’ll be happy to know that we’re applying that research to the #defconsafemode experiment.  
  
Friday and Saturday night, we’ll be providing tasty beats from the likes of Miss Jackalope, Skittish and Bus and Ninjula. Head over to the [Safe Mode Entertainment Page](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-safemode/dc-safemode-entertainment.html) for the complete lineup.
