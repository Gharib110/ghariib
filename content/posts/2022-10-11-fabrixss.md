# FabriXss

<br/>

<br/>
Service Fabric Explorer (SFX) is a tool for inspecting and managing Azure Service Fabric clusters. An attacker with existing access to a "Deployer" type user with CreateComposeDeployment permissions in a given cluster could create a malicious application with a specially-crafted name. This would lead to client-side template injection (CSTI) and storing a malicious XSS payload in a dashboard shared between users of the same cluster. If a victim user with administrative permissions logged into the compromised SFX dashboard and clicked on the aforementioned payload, the attacker could hijack their permissions to perform a cluster node reset, erasing all customized settings including passwords and security configurations. This would allow the attacker to create new passwords and thereby gain full administrator access of the cluster.
