Dave and Joe share some follow up from listener Sydney, who writes in to share her thoughts on an FCC proceeding and how it could be of greater relevance to IoT security than SBOMs and HBOMs. Dave also shares a story from a listener from last Christmas, sending a warning to holiday shoppers. Dave has two stories this week, he shares one regarding an announcement on holiday scams coming out. His other story follows Zelle finally caving in to provide some relief to scam victims.
