The wait is over - we’re ready to announce the Call for Trainers!  
  
This year we’re adding DEF CON Training – intensive, two-day courses of study aimed at building specific skills. In some cases, these courses will even carry a certification. The Trainings will be held August 15-16, the Monday and Tuesday after DEF CON.  
  
We’re looking for unique, technical, and practical presentations from trainers with deep knowledge of their subject. If that’s you, we’re offering:  
  
\- 50/50 split of the gross income.  
\- Optional test where students demonstrate their skill for a certificate.  
  
All the info you need to apply is on the [Call for Training](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cft.html) page. Get your applications in early – we look forward to seeing what you’ve got to share.
