# Coming Soon DEF CON China Party

The global pandemic of 2020 changed a lot of plans, and DEF CON was no exception. We couldn’t safely hold either of our planned in-person events, so we regretfully cancelled DEF CON 28 in Las Vegas and DEF CON China 2 in Beijing.

Fortunately, we’re a hacker community. We adapt. We reimagine. We find a way.

We created DEF CON Safe Mode, and held our first online conference. With that experience under our belt, we threw our first online New Year’s Eve party to ring in 2021.

Now we’re proud to announce another live online event, this time in VR! Along with our DEF CON China partners at Baidu we’ll be hosting a full one-day DEF CON party experience with contests, music and speakers, all in Virtual Reality.

We’ll be announcing the dates and details soon, so watch this space. We’ll also make sure you can check it out even without VR gear. Let’s make 2021 a year of increased friendship and connection for the global hacker community - no matter what conditions may come. We are hackers, and we find a way.
