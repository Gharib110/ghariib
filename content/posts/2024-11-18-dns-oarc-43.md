# DNS OARC 43

<br/>

<br/>
The DNS Operations, Analysis, and Research Center (DNS-OARC) brings together DNS service operators, DNS software implementors, and researchers together to share concerns, information and learn together about the operation and evolution of the DNS. The most recent DNS OARC workshop was held in Prague, October 2024. Here are my thoughts on some of the material that was presented and discussed at this workshop.
