# DEF CON 32 Video is Here

The [DEF CON presentations are now live](https://media.defcon.org/DEF CON 32/) and available for your perusal on the DEF CON media server, free of all commercials, data capture or pesky algorithms. We suggest clearing some disk space and personal time this weekend to snatch up some of the many, many jewels our speakers dropped in Las Vegas. While you’re on media.defcon.org you can also find the slide decks, a ton of pictures and even the DC32 soundtrack. Enjoy, learn a few things and pass it on to someone who can use it.  
  
We’ll be posting the videos on YouTube Monday.
