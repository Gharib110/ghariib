The first batch of the [DEF CON 29 Speaker lineup](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-speakers.html) is live, people. It’s up there on the DC29 website, just waiting to inform your Con decision-making. Don’t let it shine there in vain. Click on over, have a look-see. Get informed, get inspired, and most importantly get amped. DEF CON 29 is just over the horizon now. Hope we’ll see all of you there.
