# Bare Metal Hypervisors Benefits and Use Cases

<br/>

<br/>
### [Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)

A bare-metal hypervisor, also known as a Type 1 hypervisor, is a virtualization software installed directly on computing hardware, controlling both the hardware and one or more guest operating systems (guest OSes).

This technology has significantly contributed to the transformation of IT infrastructure through efficient resource utilization and scalability, as detailed in our article on the [benefits of virtualization](/resources/articles/benefits-of-virtualization#what-is-virtualization). By directly interacting with hardware, bare metal hypervisors enhance performance and security, making them a crucial tool for enterprise IT infrastructure.

In this article, you will learn about the benefits and use cases of bare metal hypervisors, comparing them to hosted hypervisors to highlight their importance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A bare metal hypervisor, also known as a Type 1 hypervisor, is virtualization software installed directly on a server’s physical hardware. Unlike a [hosted hypervisor](https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/Type-2-hypervisor-hosted-hypervisor), it doesn’t require a separate operating system to function. Instead, it is the primary layer between the hardware and the virtual machines (VMs).

### [How Does a Bare Metal Hypervisor Work?](#how-does-a-bare-metal-hypervisor-work)[](#how-does-a-bare-metal-hypervisor-work)

When installed, a bare metal hypervisor:

```
1. Boots directly from the server hardware.

2. Allocates system resources such as [CPU](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/cpu-vs-gpu), memory, and storage to virtual machines.

3. Manages the operation of each VM independently, ensuring isolation and security.
```

[FAQs](#faqs)[](#faqs)
----------------------

### [1\. What is the difference between bare metal and VM?](#1-what-is-the-difference-between-bare-metal-and-vm)[](#1-what-is-the-difference-between-bare-metal-and-vm)

**Aspect**

**Bare Metal**

**Number of OS Instances**

Typically hosts one OS instance

Can host multiple OS instances

**Resource Sharing**

No resource sharing

Multiple VMs can share physical hardware resources

**Virtualization**

Provides virtual hardware and OS

**Bare metal** refers to a physical server with no software layer between the hardware and the operating system.

A **VM (Virtual Machine)** runs on top of a hypervisor, which itself runs on underlying hardware (and possibly an operating system).

### [2\. What are the disadvantages of bare metal hypervisors?](#2-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bare-metal-hypervisors)[](#2-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-bare-metal-hypervisors)

**Disadvantage**

**Description**

**Cost**

Dedicated servers (bare metal) tend to be more expensive than shared or virtualized environments.

**Maintenance Complexity**

Managing and updating firmware, drivers, and hardware can require specialized expertise.

**Hardware Dependence**

Scaling often involves buying or upgrading physical servers, which can be slower compared to spinning up new virtual machines in a cloud environment.

**Limited Flexibility**

Without virtualization, you can’t easily move workloads or snapshot entire systems for quick recovery.

### [3\. What is an example of bare metal virtualization?](#3-what-is-an-example-of-bare-metal-virtualization)[](#3-what-is-an-example-of-bare-metal-virtualization)

A typical example is deploying a Type 1 hypervisor (such as [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/vsphere) or [Microsoft Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-overview?pivots=windows-server)) directly on the physical server. These hypervisors run directly on the hardware. They provide virtual machines without needing a separate host operating system.

### [4\. Can containers run on bare metal?](#4-can-containers-run-on-bare-metal)[](#4-can-containers-run-on-bare-metal)

Yes, [containers](/community/conceptual-articles/introduction-to-containers) (e.g., Docker containers) can run on a [bare metal server](/products/bare-metal-gpu). In this setup, you first install an operating system on the hardware. Then, you add container runtime software on top of it.

The containers then share the host OS kernel instead of using their own virtual hardware. This approach often performs better than running containers inside a VM, due to fewer layers of abstraction.

### [5\. What is the difference between bare metal and VPS?](#5-what-is-the-difference-between-bare-metal-and-vps)[](#5-what-is-the-difference-between-bare-metal-and-vps)

**Type**

**Description**

**Resource Control**

**Hardware Sharing**

**Bare Metal**

Dedicated physical server

Full control over hardware resources

No sharing

**VPS (Virtual Private Server)**

Virtual machine sharing physical resources

Limited control over shared resources

Shared with other VPS instances

-   **Bare metal**: You have a dedicated physical server all to yourself. You control all the hardware resources and can install any OS or hypervisor directly on it.
    
-   **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**: Your environment is hosted on a virtual machine that shares physical resources with other VPS instances. Though it behaves like a dedicated server, the underlying hardware is shared, which can lead to contention for resources.
    

### [6\. What are the main benefits of using a bare metal hypervisor?](#6-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-a-bare-metal-hypervisor)[](#6-what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-a-bare-metal-hypervisor)

1.  **High Performance**: Direct access to hardware without the overhead of a host OS.
2.  **Strong Isolation**: Each VM is isolated at the hardware level, reducing the attack surface.
3.  **Resource Control**: You can precisely allocate CPU, memory, storage, and network resources.
4.  **Scalability**: Adding or removing VMs can be more straightforward when the hypervisor directly controls physical resources.

### [7\. How do bare metal hypervisors improve performance and security?](#7-how-do-bare-metal-hypervisors-improve-performance-and-security)[](#7-how-do-bare-metal-hypervisors-improve-performance-and-security)

1.  **Performance**: By running directly on the hardware, there is minimal overhead compared to Type 2 hypervisors. This low-latency access to CPU, memory, and storage leads to near-native performance levels for virtual machines.
    
2.  **Security**: Each VM is isolated at the hypervisor level, reducing the risk of cross-VM attacks. Because there’s no extra host operating system to exploit, the attack surface is smaller. Security patches and updates focus specifically on the hypervisor firmware and management tools.
