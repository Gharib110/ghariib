You know how you can tell it’s DEF CON season? The Calls. When you hear the distinctive warble of the DEF CON Content calls, you know what’s up. It’s like the first robin of spring, if robins were cooler and more hacker-focused.  
  
Today we’re opening three more DEF CON 30 Calls:  
  
**[Call for Papers](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfp.html)**  
The big one. If you want to speak at DEF CON 30, it’s time to get your submission together. As always, we’re looking for fresh, technical content and the sooner you get it in, the better your chances. We can offer suggestions to help you get over the finish line, time permitting. Fortune favors the bold, so don’t delay.  
  
**[Call for Workshops](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfw.html)**  
The very popular workshop series is back for DEF CON 30. Some topics need a more time and involvement than a main-stage talk can offer. The workshops are an amazing way to share your in-depth, hands-on content with the DEF CON community.  
  
**[Demo Labs](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfdl.html)**  
Get your open source project in front of the knowledgable, curious humans of DEF CON. Get valuable feedback, find accomplices and raise your project’s profile. We provide the floor space and the audience, you provide the timely submission.  
  
The DEF CON machine is revving up, and DC30 will be here before you know it. Don’t miss your chance to get involved. The community is waiting to see what you’ve got to share.
