It’s been about two weeks since we announced [an initiative](/blog/encrypt-your-face/) to distribute versatile face coverings to help support everyone who is self-organizing for change in the streets. Since then, we’ve shipped over $25,000 worth of face coverings to organizers throughout the United States. Over $6,000 worth of merchandise was sent to Washington D.C. last week in time for the Juneteenth events in the heart of the city.

We continue to be inspired by the energy and enthusiasm that is helping to shape change in America, and many people have reached out and asked how they can help. In order to make it as easy as possible, we’re opening up a separate donation space to continue funding these efforts.
