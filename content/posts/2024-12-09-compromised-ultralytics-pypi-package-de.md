Executive Summary
-----------------

On December 4, a malicious version 8.3.41 of the popular AI library _ultralytics_ — which has almost 60 million downloads — was published to the Python Package Index (PyPI) package repository. The package contained downloader code that was downloading the _XMRig_ coinminer. The compromise of the project's build environment was achieved by exploiting a known and previously reported GitHub Actions script injection.
