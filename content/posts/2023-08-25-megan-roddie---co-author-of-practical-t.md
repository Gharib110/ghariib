Questions and topics:

1.  Of the 3 models, which do you find you use more and why? (PoP, ATT&CK, kill chain)
    
2.  What kind of orgs have ‘detection engineering’ teams? What roles are involved here, and can other teams (like IR) be involved or share a reverse role there?
    
3.  Lab setup requires an agent… any agent for ingestion or something specific? 
    
4.  How does Fleet or data ingestion work for Iot/Embedded device testing? Anything you suggest?
    
5.  How important is it to normalize your log output for ingestion? (app, web, server all tell the story)
