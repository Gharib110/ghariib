# The Dark Arts of cyber Only Malware in the Building

<br/>

<br/>
Welcome, witches, wizards, and cybersecurity sleuths! You’ve entered, Only Malware in the Building. Join us each month to brew potions of knowledge and crack the curses of today’s most intriguing cyber mysteries. Your host is Selena Larson, Proofpoint intelligence analyst and host of their podcast DISCARDED. Inspired by the residents of a building in New York’s exclusive upper west side, Selena is joined by N2K Networks Dave Bittner and Rick Howard to uncover the stories behind notable cyberattacks.  Being a security researcher is a bit like being a detective: you gather clues, analyze the evidence, and consult the experts to solve the cyber puzzle. On this episode, we dive into how Proofpoint researchers uncovered an espionage campaign casting custom malware known as "Voldemort" in August 2024. The Dark Arts practitioner behind this campaign targeted global organizations, disguising themselves as mundane tax authorities and weaving clever enchantments like using Google Sheets for command and control (C2). While their ultimate motive remains as shadowy as a cursed Horcrux, this malware is built for intelligence gathering and is primed to unleash additional attacks — likely summoning something even darker, like Cobalt Strike. Prepare your wands, and let’s dive into this tale of digital sorcery!
