Guest Jane Lee, Trust and Safety Architect at Sift, joins Dave to talk about the Digital Trust and Safety Index, Joe and Dave share some follow up from a listener, Ben, with a suggestion as an alternative to prevent clicking on those bonus phishing scams, Joe's story is about fake ticket scams for the Kansas City Chiefs NFL playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Dave's got a story about scams on Apple's App Store, and our Catch of the Day is from an anonymous listener about an email they received from their "IT department" requesting credentials (including password) when getting a new laptop. (Note: This is our first COTD that is not a scam, rather a bad policy.)
