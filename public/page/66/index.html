<p>OpenJDK announced the latest JDK 24 yesterday. This is the beginner’s guide shows how to install it in all current Ubuntu and Linux Mint releases.</p>
<p>OpenJDK 24 is a short term release with 6 months support. Ubuntu has made JDK 24 into system repository for upcoming Ubuntu 25.04, while all current Ubuntu releases may use the official tarball instead.</p>

<p>Ubuntu developers provide updates for the long term support (LTS) OpenJDK releases (e.g., JDK 8, JDK 17, and JDK 21). Users can install them simply by running a single command in terminal.</p>

<p>Tax season is a prime time for cybercriminals, especially those running phishing scams to steal W-2s. With many people filing their tax returns, scammers take advantage of the rush to trick unsuspecting individuals into handing over sensitive financial data. This blog highlights the rise in tax-related cybercrime and offers practical tips to keep your information safe.</p>
<p>W-2 phishing scams often involve emails that appear to be from the IRS or another official source, requesting personal information. These phishing emails can be highly sophisticated, often mimicking the look and feel of legitimate communications. The goal is to trick the recipient into revealing confidential data, such as social security numbers and financial information, which the perpetrator can then use for fraudulent purposes. The first step in protecting against such scams is understanding how they work and being able to recognize the red flags.</p>

<p>It’s the month of top seeds, big upsets, and Cinderella runs by the underdogs. With March Madness basketball cranking up, a fair share of online betting will be sure to follow—along with online betting scams. </p>
<p>Since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018, individual states can determine their own laws for sports betting. Soon after, states leaped at the opportunity to legalize it in some form or other. Today, nearly 40 states and the District of Columbia have “live and legal” sports betting, meaning that people can bet on single-game sports through a retail or online sportsbook or a combination of the two in their state. </p>

		<p><em>This is the second part of a two three four-part series, which covers some recent results on “verifiable computation” and possible pitfalls that could occur there. This post won’t make much sense on its own, so I urge you to start with the first part.</em></p>
<p>In the previous post we introduced a handful of concepts, including (1) the notion of “verifiable computation” proof systems (sometimes inaccurately called “ZK” by the Ethereum community), (2) hash functions, and (3) some ideal models that we use for our security proofs, and (4) the idea that these “ideal models” are bogus — and sometimes they can make us confident in schemes that are totally insecure in the real world.</p>

<p>Over the past two posts I’ve given a bit of background on four subjects: (1) interactive proof systems (for general programs/circuits), (2) the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, (3) random oracles. We’ve also talked about (4) recursive proofs, which will be important but are not <em>immediately</em> relevant.</p>

<p>Messed up or mistakenly deleted configuration files under <code>/etc</code> directory, but no backup? Here’s how to restore the files just like they were originally installed.</p>
<p>In Linux, the <code>/etc</code> directory is the location for storing system-wide configuration files. When installing a software package, it may create and/or read software specific config files under <code>/etc</code> directory for user custom configurations.</p>
<p>To prevent overriding user custom configurations, re-install software packages by default will NOT replace the files under <code>/etc</code> directory, even when you deleted the files under that directory. Though, some packages will ask if keep or replace the old configurations during installation.</p>

		<blockquote>
<p><strong>February 14, 2025:</strong> This post was updated with the recommendation to restrict S3 bucket access to an IAM role by using the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> condition key instead of the <code>aws:userid</code> condition key.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>April 2, 2021</strong>: In the section “Granting cross-account bucket access to a specific IAM role,” we updated the second policy to fix an error.</p></blockquote>

<hr>
<p>Customers often ask how to limit access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to only a specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. A popular approach has been to use the <code>Principal</code> element to list the users or roles who need access to the bucket. However, the <code>Principal</code> element needs the exact values of the <code>user</code> ARN, <code>role</code> ARN, or <code>assumed-role</code> ARN. It does not support using a wildcard (*) to include all role sessions, nor does it allow you to use policy variables.</p>

		<p>About one in three organizations that leverage cloud service providers (CSPs) use Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to November 2024 research from Synergy Research Group. This means two things. One is that when attackers are looking to get the most out of a single exploit, they will likely craft them to target AWS systems. And two, that AWS data security best practices are a timely topic for a wide range of today&rsquo;s organizations.

		<p>Monitoring your systems doesn’t have to be a chore. If you’re running an Ubuntu server and want to keep tabs on performance metrics—like CPU usage, memory, or disk I/O—Prometheus and Grafana are a dream team. Prometheus collects the data, and Grafana turns it into beautiful, easy-to-read dashboards. I’ve set this up a few times myself, and while it might seem daunting at first, it’s pretty straightforward once you break it down. Let’s walk through it together, step by step, and get your monitoring stack running on Ubuntu.</p>
