# Introducing Sift Automated Threat Hunting





The blog post introduces Sift, a new tool from GreyNoise that helps threat hunters filter out noise and prioritize investigation of potentially malicious web traffic. Sift uses AI techniques like large language models to analyze HTTP requests seen across GreyNoise's sensor network and generate reports on new and relevant threats.

The blog post introduces Sift, a new tool from GreyNoise that helps threat hunters filter out noise and prioritize investigation of potentially malicious web traffic. Sift uses AI techniques like large language models to analyze HTTP requests seen across GreyNoise's sensor network and generate reports on new and relevant threats. The reports describe and analyze suspicious payloads, estimate the threat level, provide contextual tags/information on associated IPs, and suggest Suricata rules to detect similar traffic. This allows analysts to focus only on the most critical potential threats instead of sifting through millions of requests manually. Sift is currently limited to HTTP traffic but will expand to other protocols soon. The post invites readers to provide feedback on how to further develop Sift's capabilities, such as expanding historical reports, customizing for specific organizations, analyzing submitted PCAPs, and integrating additional GreyNoise data/tools.
