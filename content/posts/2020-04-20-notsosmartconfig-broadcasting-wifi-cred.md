# NotSoSmartConfig broadcasting WiFi credentials Over-The-Air

<br/>

<br/>
During one of our latest [IoT Penetration Tests](https://www.shielder.com/services/iot-security/) we tested a device based on the [ESP32 SoC](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/resources) by EspressIF. While assessing the activation procedure we faced for the first time a beautiful yet dangerous protocol: **SmartConfig**.

The idea behind the [SmartConfig](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_smartconfig.html) protocol is to allow an unconfigured IoT device to connect to a WiFi network without requiring a direct connection between the configurator and the device itself – I know, it’s scary.
