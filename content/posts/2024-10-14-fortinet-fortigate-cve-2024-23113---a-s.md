# Fortinet FortiGate CVE-2024-23113 - A Super Complex Vulnerability In A Super Secure Appliance In 2024

<br/>

<br/>
Today we'd like to share a recent journey into (yet another) SSLVPN appliance vulnerability - a Format String vulnerability, unusually, in Fortinet's FortiGate devices.

It affected (before patching) all currently-maintained branches, and recently was highlighted by CISA as being exploited-in-the-wild.

**This must be the first time**
