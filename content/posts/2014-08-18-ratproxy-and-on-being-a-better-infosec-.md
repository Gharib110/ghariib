# Ratproxy and on being a better Infosec Professional

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we go into a proxy program called "Ratproxy", discussed it's ins and outs.  Plus, Mr. Boettcher and I have a discussion about how we as infosec people should work with developers and IT professionals to provide them training and understanding of security concepts.
