# Whats Your Problem trailer

<br/>

<br/>
We’re sharing a preview of a podcast we enjoy called “What’s Your Problem?”  Every week on What’s Your Problem, entrepreneurs talk about the future they’re trying to build and the problems they have to solve to get there. How do you build cars that can actually drive themselves? How do you use technology to bring down the cost of airfares? And how do you teach a computer to understand sports?  Hosted by former Planet Money host Jacob Goldstein, What’s Your Problem? helps listeners understand the problems really smart people are trying to solve right now.  Listen to What’s Your Problem? at https://podcasts.pushkin.fm/wyphumans
