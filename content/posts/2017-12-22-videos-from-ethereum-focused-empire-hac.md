# Videos from Ethereum-focused Empire Hacking

<br/>

<br/>
On December 12, over 150 attendees learned how to write and hack secure smart contracts at the final Empire Hacking meetup of 2017. Thank you to everyone who came, to our superb speakers, and to Datadog for hosting this meetup at their office. Watch the presentations again We believe strongly that the community should share \[â€¦\]
