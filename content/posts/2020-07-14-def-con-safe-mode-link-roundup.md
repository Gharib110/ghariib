DEF CON Safe Mode is almost here! If you’re just getting around to checking out the offerings, here’s a little roundup of the stuff you need to know.

**Visit the Forums:** The planning for the many events of DEF CON Safe Mode is all happening on the DEF CON Forums. Whether you want to register for an event, offer to help out with a village, or just get a start on planning your DC weekend, you can find the relevant thread in the [DC28 planning forum](https://forum.defcon.org/node/231980).

**#Badgelife is still in effect:** The DEF CON community creates a lot of really amazing badges, many of which are available for sale and/or trade. You can catch up with the community badges on the [DEF CON Forums #badgeleife thread](https://forum.defcon.org/node/231997). You can also follow the hashtag #badgelife on Twitter and Instagram.

Of course, DEF CON has a badge this year, too. We’ll be announcing it quite soon. It’s the creation of returning puzzle master LosT (@1o57), so you’ll want to set aside some time to unock its mysteries.

**Swag:** If you’re wondering how to get your hands on DEF CON Safe Mode swag this year, we’ve got you covered over on the [DEF CON eBay store](https://www.ebay.com/str/defconcommunications)!

So dive in! Get yourself set up on Discord and Twitch, fire up the DEF CON stream on [soma fm](https://somafm.com/defcon/) for some musical inspiration and get your mind right. DEF CON 28 will be upon us before you know it.
