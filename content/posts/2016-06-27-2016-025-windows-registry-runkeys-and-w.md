# 2016-025-Windows Registry Runkeys and where malware likes to hide

<br/>

<br/>
The windows registry has come a long way from it's humble beginnings in #Windows 3.11 (Windows for Workgroups).  This week, we discuss the structure of the Windows registry, as well as some of the inner workings of the registry itself.

We also discuss where are some good places to find malware, some of the key values that you can find in the #registry and their meanings. We also discuss what atomicity is and how the registry is a lot like a database in how it functions.

And no podcast about Windows #forensics should be done without talking about a tool, and our friend David #Longenecker (@dnlongen on Twitter) created a cross-platform tool that allows you to take exports of the registry and analyze them without need to be physically on the host. You can find reglister here:

We finish up discussing our #DerbyCon giveaways and a peek at what will be a very interesting podcast next week.
