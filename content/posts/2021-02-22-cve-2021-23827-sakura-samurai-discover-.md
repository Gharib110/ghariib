Within several minutes, John noticed a directory named “uploadtemps” C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Local\\Keybase\\uploadtemps The directory contained randomized folders: John noticed that inside of these folders, photos that had been previously pasted into conversations \[but deleted through either normal means or exploded\] remained, unencrypted.
