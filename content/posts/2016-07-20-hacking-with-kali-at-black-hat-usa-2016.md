Kali Linux Dojo, BlackHat 2016 - Las Vegas
------------------------------------------

We have really enjoyed doing the [**Dojo at Black Hat**](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/kali-linux.html) the last few years. It’s been a great opportunity to show off some of the lesser known (but oh so useful) [features of Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/features/) as well as interact with the user base. But one of the limitations of the previous structure was that while this was a hands-on exercise, many attendees moved at different paces from each other. So we wanted to move towards more of a “self service” model where **attendees can drop in, have access to the training material, and will be free to work at their own pace**. We accomplished with the new model we will be premiering this year, allowing everyone to take as much, or as little, time needed to get a working Kali install customized to their desires. While this is being done, **Kali developers will be onsite and interacting with everyone** on a consistent basis.

Hacking the playground with Kali Linux
--------------------------------------

This leads to the next major change in structure, as in previous years a commonly heard question was “Great! I have this beautiful Kali install, now what do I do with it?”. This year, we have a great answer for this: **Hack our systems**!

Our good friends at [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/) have been gracious enough to provide us with a number of systems that have been preconfigured with interesting and unique vulnerabilities. This environment will will be setup in the room, and attendees can connect into it and put Kali Linux to use, hacking these systems to your hearts content. Whats more, we will be providing some extra incentive for you to **hack all the things**, by giving away **prizes** to those that obtain the highest score.

Our cool giveaways in the Playground CTF

Here are a few pics of the Kali hardware we’ll be giving away to our contest winners in the Kali Dojo CTF:

What to bring if you want to attend:
------------------------------------

Now that we have your attention, here’s what you need to bring!

-   Powerful 64bit laptop with Kali Rolling (!) installed in a VM or natively.
-   At least 40 GB free space in the VM or laptop for generating ISOs
-   8GB USB 3.0 stick (or larger) for creating Kali Live USBs.

We will have Kali VMWare images for you to download on site - so if you choose this option, make sure you have the latest VMware Workstation of Fusion installed. Yes, make sure it’s the LATEST version!

Come say hello!
---------------

Thats right. You can get a **pre-release version of Kali Linux** before its available to the public, you can **customize it to yours hearts content**. And then you can use it to **hack vulnerable machines** to accumulate points. And we will give you free stuff for doing all this. We know there is a lot going on at Black Hat Vegas, as the convention gets better every year. We do hope that you budget some time to drop on the Kali Dojo on **Aug. 4th**, as we will be going all day.
