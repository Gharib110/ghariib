# Do AI Trust and Safety Measures Deserve to Fail

<br/>

<br/>
It’s the last and probably longest Cyberlaw Podcast episode of 2023. To lead off, [Megan Stifel](https://securityandtechnology.org/team/core-team/megan-stifel-2/) takes us through a batch of stories about ways that AI, and especially AI trust and safety, manage to look remarkably fallible. Anthropic released a paper showing that race, gender, and age discrimination by AI models was real but [could be dramatically reduced](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/anthropics-latest-tactic-to-stop-racist-ai-asking-it-really-really-really-really-nicely/__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYdQZOFBMA$) by instructing The Model to “really, really, really” avoid such discrimination. (Buried in the paper was the fact that the original, severe AI [bias disfavored older white men](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03689.pdf), as did the residual bias that asking nicely didn’t eliminate.) Bottom line from Anthropic seems to be, “Our technology is a really cool toy, but don’t use if for anything that matters.”) In keeping with that theme, Google’s highly touted OpenAI competitor Gemini was release to mixed reviews when the model couldn’t correctly identify recent Oscar winners or a French word with six letters (it offered “amour”). The good news was for people who hate AI’s ham-handed political correctness; it turns out you can [ask another AI model how to jailbreak your model](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.scientificamerican.com/article/jailbroken-ai-chatbots-can-jailbreak-other-chatbots/?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYddOsoopg$), a request that can make the task go 25 times faster.

This could be the week that determines the fate of FISA section 702, [David Kris](https://culperpartners.com/) reports. It looks as though two bills will go to the House floor, and only one will survive. [Judiciary’s bill](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/house-judiciary-committee-clears-bill-to-renew-surveillance-tools__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYcWh1XfjA$) is a grudging renewal of 702 for a mere three years, full of procedures designed to cripple the program. The [intelligence committee’s bill](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/house-committee-approves-section-702-renewal__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYdn1Jwz0g$) beats the FBI around the head and shoulders but preserves the core of 702. David and I explore the “queen of the hill” procedure that will allow members to vote for either bill, both, or none, and will send to the Senate the version that gets the most votes. 

[Gus Hurwitz](https://www.law.upenn.edu/faculty/ghurwitz) looks at the [FTC’s last-ditch appeal to stop the Microsoft-Activision merger](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-ftc-tries-again-stop-microsofts-already-closed-deal-activision-2023-12-06/__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYdELRumsg$). The best case, he suspects, is that the appeal will be rejected without actually repudiating the pet theories of the FTC’s hipster antitrust lawyers.

Megan and I examine the latest [HHS proposal to impose new cybersecurity requirements on hospitals](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/hhs-proposes-cyber-requirements-for-hospitals__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYcDV63biA$). David, meanwhile, looks for possible motivations behind the [FBI’s procedures for companies who want help in delaying SEC cyber incident disclosures](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/sec-cyber-incident-reporting-rules-fbi-delay-guidance__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYd7yzfcGg$). Then Megan and I consider the [tough new UK rules](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/uk-ofcom-age-verification-rules-pornography-sites__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYf8CYsuJQ$) for establishing the age of online porn consumers. I think they’ll hurt Pornhub’s litigation campaign against states trying to regulate children’s access to porn sites. 

The race to 5G is over, Gus notes, and [it looks like even the winners lost](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.theverge.com/23991136/5g-network-att-verizon-tmobile-cost-competition__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYfi1SbZZQ$). Faced with the threat of Chinese 5G domination and an industry sure that 5G was the key to the future, many companies and countries devoted massive investments to the technology, but it’s now widely deployed and no one sees much benefit. There is more than one lesson here for industrial policy and the unpredictable way technologies disseminate.

23andme gets some time in the barrel, with Megan and I both dissing its “lawyerly” response to a history of data breaches – namely changing its terms of service it [harder for customers to sue](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/23andme-updates-user-agreement-to-prevent-data-breach-lawsuits/__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYex8Lr3-g$) for data breaches.

Gus reminds us that the Biden FCC only took office in that last month or two, and it is determined to catch up with the FTC in advancing foolish and doomed regulatory initiatives. This week’s example, remarkably, isn’t net neutrality. It’s worse. The Commission is building a sweeping regulatory structure on an obscure section of the 2021 infrastructure act that calls for the FCC to “facilitate equal access to broadband internet access service...”: Think we’re hyperventilating? Read Commissioner Brendan Carr’s [eloquent takedown](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398244A1.pdf?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYdRNLX5ow$) of the whole initiative. 

[Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has a been in his bonnet over government access to smartphone notifications](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/wyden-warns-of-governments-spying-on-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYcr3zD3Rg$). Megan and I do our best to understand his concern and how seriously to take it. 

Wrapping up, Gus offers a quick take on [Meta’s broadening attack on the constitutionality of the FTC’s current structure](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.fastcompany.com/90990758/metas-new-legal-strategy-calling-the-ftcs-actions-unconstitutional?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYefOm-MxA$). David takes satisfaction from the Justice Department’s patient and successful pursuit of [Russian Hacker Vladimir Dunaev for his role in creating TrickBot](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/web.getmatter.com/entry/44447598__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYcPWb7pLg$). Gus notes that [South Korea’s law imposing internet costs on content providers](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/twitch-to-shut-down-in-korea-over-prohibitively-expensive-network-fees/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9zbGFzaGRvdC5vcmcv&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADmRvzEM-lz2WOydPUAK94SudKnh5XtzCmkIcxe93f6Idm8Ux03ogC_Hnp5sStRDMugDQJNGYC_Zm7cCzKOSm1ajW7gLpjt3ol9moonwZx-AiPDt0eGnKI19h8QBIi87gJmlKTFj1KpugKfcc3LTF5423EsPFeWrbYMBBqL1Fbi0&utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!wMLIvOxqogsRQ21HbgpwF7VqkLNpXWE25Z5Kp1tySH_PUCbbKxWviC2V9YWGJX5iSvwez8SvyYdA1cbWKw$) is no match for the law of supply and demand.

Finally, in quick hits we cover:
