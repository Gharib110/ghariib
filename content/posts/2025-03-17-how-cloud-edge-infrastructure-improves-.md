# How Cloud Edge Infrastructure Improves Round-Trip Time

<br/>

<br/>
In this work, we investigate the improvements in network latency across six European countries - Germany, Finland, Poland, Bulgaria, Greece, and Czechia - when leveraging cloud edge infrastructure. Using ping measurements from RIPE Atlas, we analyse the impact of cloud edge solutions provided by three major cloud providers: Amazon, Azure, and Google. Our results demonstrate that cloud edge infrastructure significantly reduces network latency in all selected countries, with the most substantial improvements observed in regions without local cloud regions, such as Greece, Bulgaria, and Czechia.
