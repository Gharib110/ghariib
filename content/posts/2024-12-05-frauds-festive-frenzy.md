On Hacking Humans, Dave Bittner, Joe Carrigan, and Maria Varmazis (also host of N2K's daily space podcast, T-Minus), are once again sharing the latest in social engineering scams, phishing schemes, and criminal exploits that are making headlines to help our audience become aware of what is out there. This week, our hosts dive into some follow up from listener Will. who writes in about the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. They also share after an anonymous listener writes in with a suggestion on filtering scam emails using the DocuSign API. Maria follows the story of how Black Friday is increasingly being dubbed "Black Fraud Day," as criminals exploit the festive shopping frenzy to scam eager bargain hunters, often using AI to create convincing fraud schemes. Joe has two stories this week. The first one is on scammers exploiting financially distressed individuals by posing as the "Bankruptcy Fraud Watchdog Group," threatening bankruptcy filers with false accusations and fines payable in Bitcoin, while warning them against contacting their attorneys. The second story explores the rise of deepfake scams in the U.S., with criminals using AI-generated videos of celebrities like Elon Musk to deceive victims into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments, contributing to over $12 billion in annual fraud losses. Finally, Dave share's a story on a new wave of deepfake scams, where AI-generated videos of Elon Musk trick unsuspecting victims into investing large sums, contributing to billions in fraud losses.
