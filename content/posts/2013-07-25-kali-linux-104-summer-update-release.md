### More Kali Linux ARM Images

Our quest to get Kali Linux running on popular ARM hardware is going strong and our trusted contributor, [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/) , has provided new ARM images for the **BeagleBone Black**, **CuBox**, and **Efika MX** to our [growing collection](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).

### Seamless upgrade Of Kali Linux

As usual, you do not need to re-download Kali Linux 1.0.4 if you already have it installed. A regular “apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade” will do the job of getting you to the latest and greatest!
