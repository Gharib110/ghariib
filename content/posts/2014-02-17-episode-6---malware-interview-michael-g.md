# Episode 6 - Malware Interview Michael Gough Part 1

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we are excited to have Michael Gough, a local malware researcher from Mi2Security on with us to talk about types of malware, infection vectors, some of the tools that users have available to them to detect and prevent malware.  We also discuss who gains from malware infections, the 'bad guys', and even the AV/Malware detection companies.  We also talk about how his software program "Sniper Forensic Toolkit" would detect malware.
