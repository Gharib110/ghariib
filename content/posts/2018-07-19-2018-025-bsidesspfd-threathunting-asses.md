# 2018-025-BsidesSPFD threathunting assessing risk

<br/>

<br/>
Sorry, this week's show took an odd turn, and we don't have much in the way of show notes... Ms. Berlin is recovering from knee surgery, and we wish her a speedy recovery.

Bryan B. got back from [BsidesSPFD](https://twitter.com/bsidesspfd "BsidesSPFD"), MO this week, after what was a well-received talk on building community. Lots of other excellent talks from speakers like Ms. [Sunny Wear](https://twitter.com/sunnywear) , and impromptu panel with [Ben Miller](https://twitter.com/securithid) and a whole host of others, including:

@ViciousData  
@killianditch  
@fang0654  
@SunnyWear  
@awsmhacks  
@sysopfb  
@killamjr

We started talking about malware, and we ended up discussing a new channel in the BrakeSec Slack on #threatHunting. Appears there's a lot of information out there on the topic, so much so, that SANS is having a whole conference around it.
