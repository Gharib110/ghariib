# Squid A RISC-V Emulator For Vulnerability Research





Squid is a powerful RISC-V emulator designed specifically for vulnerability research and fuzzing. It leverages Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation instead of Just-In-Time (JIT), allowing users to rewrite binary code before emulation. This feature provides full control over system calls and events during runtime, making it ideal for creating custom sanitizers and
