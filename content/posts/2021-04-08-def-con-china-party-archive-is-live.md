If you didn’t get to participate in the DEF CON China Party, we have your back. We’ve got a [full archive of the presentations and music](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-china-party-archive.html) for you to browse through at your convenience. We can’t provide you the experience of seeing The Dark Tangent’s avatar zooming across the virtual skyline with his jetboots, but the rest of the experience is on tap for you. Enjoy, and pass it on.
