# New Features Coming to Signal Groups

Whether it’s staying in touch with family and friends, planning a party, scheduling an event, getting work done, or [organizing for change](/blog/blur-tools/), group chats are an increasingly important part of Signal. Today we’re releasing a new version of Signal groups that gives you a richer private group experience with group admins, granular permissions, @mentions and more. If you’re excited to try out these features now, you can create a new group to do so. These features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups in a future update.

Signal groups are built on top of the new [private group system](/blog/signal-private-group-system/) technology we previewed last year, which gives you a modern group chat experience while keeping your groups private: the Signal service has no access to your group memberships, group titles, group avatars, or group attributes.
