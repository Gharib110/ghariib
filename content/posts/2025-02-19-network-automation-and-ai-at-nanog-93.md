# Network Automation and AI at NANOG 93

<br/>

<br/>
The dominant theme of the presentations this time around at NANOG 93 was the combination of automation of network command and control and the application of Artificial Intelligence tools to this control function. The interest in AI appears to have heightened of late, and while the hype levels are impressive even for an industry that can get totally fixated on hype, the deliverables so far still appear to fall somewhat short.
