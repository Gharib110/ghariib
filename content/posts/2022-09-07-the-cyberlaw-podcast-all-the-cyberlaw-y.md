# The Cyberlaw Podcast All the Cyberlaw You Missed in August

<br/>

<br/>
This is our return-from-hiatus episode. [Jordan Schneider](https://rhg.com/) kicks things off by recapping passage of a major U.S. semiconductor-building subsidy bill, while new contributor [Brian Fleming](https://www.steptoe.com/en/lawyers/brian-j-fleming.html) talks with [Nick Weaver](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/) about [new regulatory investment restrictions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-02/us-to-stop-tsmc-intel-from-adding-advanced-chip-fabs-in-china?utm_source=pocket_mylist) and [new export controls on (artificial Intelligence (AI) chips going to China](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/techcrunch.com/2022/09/02/china-us-nvidia-export-ban/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0BmX86qoxdYV96kVVjHi877cr7Ae4315jC4HUDsYyjNruce6VxdVliCRjnjoHYPE5hLQG31XtD8HDv3T_Gdjh5rhQGuMJjpSuXVFXccVMrdmHh0mn6T6m-qo_XlUxJNqZP07uzeb4V3o570gpi9aZ89SN6POuKO_5_Gh7bxj68__;!!ApXA7kLm!xmlmZcLK06uBemTsTnVnQVdCgh3jG1tL1nU6peLUQ5abwSNaI-3WJBr6v3RodmLEheQuJKEyLUTKvvn_2xth$). Jordan also covers a [big corruption scandal arising](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/china-corruption-probes-stem-from-anger-over-failed-chip-plans?utm_source=pocket_mylist) from China’s big chip-building subsidy program, leading me to wonder when we’ll have our version.

Brian and Nick cover the month’s biggest cryptocurrency policy story, the imposition of [OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash](https://therecord.media/u-s-sanctions-tornado-cash-cryptocurrency-mixer/). They agree that, while the outer limits of sanctions aren’t entirely clear, they are likely to show that sometimes the U.S. Code actually does trump the digital version. Nick points listeners to his bracing essay, [OFAC Around and Find Out](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.lawfareblog.com/ofac-around-and-find-out__;!!ApXA7kLm!0bUtlnh3UrEa9GDCENK1jeZchRorXawIs843vJnj34HdCigOio9JGK0x2CWPPcxn2wUGh2CvOp7K6K7FDwxRTDU$).

[Paul Rosenzweig](http://redbranchconsulting.com/) reprises his role as the voice of reason in the [debate](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/17/23306570/period-tracking-apps-privacy?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4) over [location tracking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/25/google-maps-abortions/?utm_source=pocket_mylist) and [Dobbs.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf) (Literally. Paul and I did an hour-long panel on the topic last week. It’s available [here](https://regproject.org/video/dobbs-and-the-potential-implications-for-data-privacy/).) I reprise my role as Chief Privacy Skeptic, calling the Dobb/location fuss an overrated tempest in a teapot.

Brian takes on one aspect of the Mudge whistleblower complaint about Twitter security: Twitter’s [poor record](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22186782/whistleblower_disclosure.pdf) at keeping foreign spies from infiltrating its workforce and getting unaudited access to its customer records. In a coincidence, he notes, a former Twitter employee was just convicted of “[spying lite](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/former-twitter-employee-is-convicted-of-spying-for-saudi-arabia#xj4y7vzkg)”, proves it’s as good at national security as it is at content moderation.

Meanwhile, returning to U.S.-China economic relations, Jordan notes the survival [of high-level](https://therecord.media/tiktok-asks-house-of-representatives-to-rescind-cyber-advisory-about-company/) [government concerns](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/14/technology/tiktok-china-washington.html) about TikTok. I note that, since these concerns first surfaced in the Trump era, TikTok’s lobbying efforts have only grown more sophisticated. Speaking of which, Klon Kitchen has done a good job of highlighting [DJI’s increasingly sophisticated lobbying](https://current.thedispatch.com/p/red-china-backs-the-blue?utm_source=pocket_mylist) in Washington D.C.

The Cloudflare decision to [deplatform Kiwi Farms](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/cloudflare-kiwi-farms-keffals-anti-trans-rcna44834?utm_source=pocket_mylist) kicks off a donnybrook, with Paul and Nick on one side and me on the other. It’s a classic Cyberlaw Podcast debate. 

In quick hits and updates:

-   Nick and I cover the sad story of the [Dad who photographed his baby’s private parts at a doctor’s request](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!0bUtlnh3UrEa9GDCENK1jeZchRorXawIs843vJnj34HdCigOio9JGK0x2CWPPcxn2wUGh2CvOp7K6K7FUAZtv5Q$) and, thanks to Google’s lack of human appellate review, lost his email, his phone number, and all of the accounts that used the phone for 2FA. 
-   Paul brings us up to speed on the U.S.-EU data fight: and teases [tomorrow’s webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmTeyGcmGR4&ab_channel=TheFederalistSociety) on the topic.
-   Nick explains the big changes likely to come to the pornography world because of a [lawsuit against Visa](https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/pornhub-visa-child-pornography-court-ruling-1235330052/?sub_action=logged_in&utm_source=pocket_mylist). And why Twitter narrowly averted [its own child sex scandal](https://www.theverge.com/23327809/twitter-onlyfans-child-sexual-content-problem-elon-musk?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4). 
-   I note that Google’s bias against GOP fundraising emails has led to an unlikely result: less [spam filtering for all such emails](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/11/23301554/google-gmail-spam-filters-republicans-gop-trump?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4). 

And, after waiting too long, Brian Krebs [retracts the post about a Ubiquity “breach” that led the company to sue him.](https://getpocket.com/read/3693235334)
