Two years ago Ross Marks created the [FridaLab](https://rossmarks.uk/blog/fridalab/) challenge as a playground to test and learn how to use the [Frida](https://frida.re) dynamic instrumentation toolkit.

At that time, I solved FridaLab and wrote a [writeup](https://www.shielder.com/blog/2019/02/fridalab-writeup/) about it explaining the main APIs and usages of Frida for Android. This helped others to start getting familiar with it and as a reference when developing Frida scripts.

After trying Qiling for some time I decided to follow [Ross Marksâ€™](https://twitter.com/0xRoM) steps and to develop a basic playground challenge to make use of the main Qiling features and I _obviously_ called it **QilingLab**.
