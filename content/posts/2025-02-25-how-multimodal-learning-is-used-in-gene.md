# How Multimodal Learning is Used in Generative AI

<br/>

<br/>
[Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)
----------------------------------------------

AI Trends are transforming the artificial intelligence landscape through innovations in generative AI and its ability to operate across multiple modalities. The evolution of [generative AI](/resources/articles/generative-ai) has transformed how we produce text, images, videos, and audio content. Previous AI systems functioned by performing specific tasks and operating within one modality(unimodal AI). For example, a text-based model produces written content exclusively, and an image model generates only visual elements. The development of multimodal generative AI represents a significant advancement, allowing AI systems to process information across multiple data modalities.

Our article explores multimodality in generative AI, discussing its fundamental principles and real-world applications. It will compare popular multimodal AI models including [OpenAI’s GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/), [Google DeepMind’s Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/), and [Meta’s ImageBind](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/), and address significant industry challenges.

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)[](#prerequisites)
-------------------------------------------------

-   An understanding of [machine learning (ML)](/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-machine-learning) and [deep learning](/community/conceptual-articles/optimizing-deep-learning-pipelines) mechanisms to understand how generative AI models work with various data types.
-   A thorough understanding of text-to-image, text-to-text, and text-to-audio generative models like GPT, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion builds a strong foundation for content generation.

[What Does Multimodal Generative AI Refer To?](#what-does-multimodal-generative-ai-refer-to)[](#what-does-multimodal-generative-ai-refer-to)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multimodal generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that handle and create content from multiple data modalities. In AI, ‘modality’ describes various data forms, including text, visual content such as images and videos, audio files, and data from smart devices.

To compare traditional AI with generative AI, check out our article on [AI vs GenAI](/resources/articles/ai-vs-genai).

Multimodal AI uses cross-modal learning to generate richer results through multiple input types. Let’s consider a multimodal generative AI system. The system can read scene descriptions and analyze corresponding images to produce new content, such as audio narrations and detailed images. This is achieved by merging data from both modalities. The fusion of information allows AI to develop deep understanding, generating responses that accurately reflect real-world complexities.

[Multimodal AI vs. Generative AI](#multimodal-ai-vs-generative-ai)[](#multimodal-ai-vs-generative-ai)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Researchers must understand the difference between multimodal AI and generative AI despite their frequent overlap in practices:

-   **Generative AI:** Generative AI develops artificial intelligence systems that generate new content including visual outputs from tools like DALL·E, [Stable Diffusion](/community/tutorials/stable-diffusion-gpu-droplet). It can also generate media formats like text, audio, and video.
-   **Multimodal AI:** Multimodal AI combines various data types and processes them. Many recent advances in generative AI originate from multimodal approaches even though not all multimodal AI systems function as generative models. Generative AI multimodal models integrate these concepts by combining different data sources to produce inventive and complex results.

Multimodal AI and generative AI work together to create a unified system instead of opposition between the two approaches. Combining multiple data inputs from various modalities boosts the creativity and authenticity of generative models by supplying diverse and rich data sources.

[How Does Multimodal AI Work?](#how-does-multimodal-ai-work)[](#how-does-multimodal-ai-work)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multimodal AI fundamentally depends on its capability to process and integrate various data types through a unified computational framework. The process requires data processing, cross-model alignment,data fusion, and decoding.

![Image](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/010AI-ML/2024/Shaoni/Adrien/25-feb/2-mml.png)

### [Data Processing](#data-processing)[](#data-processing)

The core of multimodal AI depends on data processing. This involves specialized preprocessing methods that convert raw data from multiple modalities.

For example, textual data will require tokenization during preprocessing while image data will leverage convolutional neural networks to extract visual features. Audio data transformation for AI models can include converting it into spectrograms before it can be used as input for AI models.

### [Cross-Modal Alignment](#cross-modal-alignment)[](#cross-modal-alignment)

Models must accurately align their extracted features. Through cross-modal learning methods, models can learn to create meaningful associations between diverse data types. For example, text-based descriptions can help an image recognition system identify objects more accurately. Conversely, images can provide context that improves text generation (e.g., specifying the color of an object).

This interplay requires the model to perform **cross-attention**, a mechanism that allows different parts of the model’s architecture to focus on relevant aspects of each modality. For instance, a text token describing a “red ball” in an image might align with the corresponding visual features in the image that represent a red spherical object.

### [Data Fusion](#data-fusion)[](#data-fusion)

The process of data fusion involves combining synchronized features into one unified representation. The fusion layer holds a critical function since it identifies the most important details from each modality that apply to the specific task. There are several fusion techniques:

-   **Early Fusion**: Integrating raw features at the initial stage helps the model to learn directly from combined data.
-   **Late Fusion**: Separately process each modality before combining their outputs.
-   **Hybrid Fusion**: Hybrid fusion combines partial representations of each modality through multiple network stages, combining early and late fusion elements.

### [Decoding/Generation](#decoding-generation)[](#decoding-generation)

The decoder stage transforms the unified representation into the target output for generative tasks using a transformer or recurrent neural network. Depending on the structure of the model, the resulting output can appear as text, images, or various other formats. The system uses its integrated multimodal knowledge to generate new content.

[How Multimodal Used in Generative AI Examples](#how-multimodal-used-in-generative-ai-examples)[](#how-multimodal-used-in-generative-ai-examples)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will examine some multimodal generative AI examples that demonstrate how text, images, audio, and additional elements integrate effectively:

![Image](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/010AI-ML/2024/Shaoni/Adrien/25-feb/3-mml.png)

### [Text-to-Image Generation Using Diffusion Models](#text-to-image-generation-using-diffusion-models)[](#text-to-image-generation-using-diffusion-models)

-   **Process**: A user submits a descriptive text prompt like "A tranquil lake bathed in moonlight.
    -   **Result**: The model produces a corresponding image because it learned how to associate textual descriptions with visual features.
    -   **Applications**: These include digital artistry, marketing campaigns, and conceptual design work.

### [Audio-Visual Narrative Generation](#audio-visual-narrative-generation)[](#audio-visual-narrative-generation)

-   **Combining Text and Video**: When users describe a scene through text input, the AI system generates an animated video with appropriate audio effects.
-   **Typical Pipeline:**
    -   **Text Encoder:** Convert scene description to embeddings.
    -   **Video Generator:** The video generation process requires a [GAN](/community/tutorials/implementing-gans-in-tensorflow) or diffusion model to generate frames.
    -   **Audio Synthesis:** Generate corresponding audio.
-   **Use Cases**: The system finds application in movie trailer production, gaming sequence generation, and automated social media content creation.

### [Speech-to-Image Models](#speech-to-image-models)[](#speech-to-image-models)

-   **Description**: These models take spoken input which may contain emotional cues and generate an image.
-   **Technical Approach**: The system begins with audio transcription or transformation into semantic embedding that will be used to generate the corresponding image.
-   **Challenges**: This requires robust speech recognition capabilities and advanced cross-modal alignment.

### [Real-Time Subtitling with Contextual Suggestions](#real-time-subtitling-with-contextual-suggestions)[](#real-time-subtitling-with-contextual-suggestions)

-   **Live Events**: The AI system listens to live speech to create text captions displayed on the screen while monitoring audience reactions through a camera to adjust subtitle detail and style.
-   **Impact**: This method enhances user accessibility and involvement through dynamic and context-sensitive captioning.

### [Image Captioning and Emotion Analysis](#image-captioning-and-emotion-analysis)[](#image-captioning-and-emotion-analysis)

-   **Multimodal Input**: The visual representation is paired with descriptive text or audio that describes the event.
-   **Outcome**: The generated description provides a detailed identification of objects and individuals with their emotional states.
-   **Utility**: Valuable in social media, photo-sharing applications, or law enforcement for analyzing footage from body cameras.

These examples highlight how multimodal used in generative AI, significantly broadens the potential for content development and user engagement. By using AI-powered solutions that integrate multiple data streams, organizations and individuals can generate outputs that are more innovative and contextually relevant.

[Multimodal AI Architecture](#multimodal-ai-architecture)[](#multimodal-ai-architecture)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The development of robust multimodal AI systems is supported by the encoder-decoder framework, attention mechanisms, and training objectives.

![Image](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/010AI-ML/2024/Shaoni/Adrien/25-feb/4-mml.png)

### [Encoder-Decoder Framework](#encoder-decoder-framework)[](#encoder-decoder-framework)

Multimodal deep learning frequently uses the transformer-based encoder-decoder framework as its primary method. In such a system:

-   **Encoder**: modality (text, images, audio, etc.) is processed by a specialized encoder.
-   **Multimodal Fusion**: The outputs from these specialized encoders undergo projection into shared embedding space which allows cross-attention layers to learn modality alignment.
-   **Decoder**: The decoder transforms the fused multimodal representation into the final output which may be text, image, or another format.

### [Attention Mechanisms](#attention-mechanisms)[](#attention-mechanisms)

Effective multimodal systems require attention mechanisms to enable models to focus on the most relevant components across various modalities. For example, the model can focus on particular regions of an image that match specific words when it generates textual descriptions of images.

### [Training Objectives](#training-objectives)[](#training-objectives)

Common training objectives for multimodal models include:

-   **Contrastive Learning**: The goal of this training objective is to make the representations of different modalities from the same instance converge toward similarity.
-   **Generative Loss**: Generating text, images, or other content requires minimizing a loss function such as cross-entropy.
-   **Reconstruction Loss**: Autoencoder-like systems train models to restore missing modalities through their reconstruction learning process.

Let’s consider the following code:

```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Mult_Mod_Att_Fus(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, txt_dim, img_dim, aud_dim, fus_dim, num_heads=4):
        super(Mult_Mod_Att_Fus, self).__init__()
       
        # We performed the linear projections to a share fusion dimension
        self.txt_fc = nn.Linear(txt_dim, fus_dim)
        self.img_fc = nn.Linear(img_dim, fus_dim)
        self.aud_fc = nn.Linear(aud_dim, fus_dim)

        # Multi-head Self-Attention for Fusion
        self.attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=fus_dim, num_heads=num_heads, batch_first=True)

        # This is our final MLP for learned fusion
        self.fusion_fc = nn.Linear(fus_dim, fus_dim)

    def forward(self, txt_feat, img_feat, aud_feat):
        # Fusion dimension through projection of each modalitity
        proj_txt = self.txt_fc(txt_feat)  # (batch, seq_len, fus_dim)
        proj_img = self.img_fc(img_feat)
        proj_aud = self.aud_fc(aud_feat)

        # We  Stack modalities into sequence
        fus_inp = torch.stack([proj_txt, proj_img, proj_aud], dim=1)

        # Here we can apply Multi-Head Attention for feature alignment
        attn_out, _ = self.attn(fus_inp, fus_inp, fus_inp)

        # Pass through fusion MLP for final feature aggregation
        fused_rep = self.fusion_fc(attn_out.mean(dim=1))

        return fused_rep

# Example Usage:
txt_feat = torch.randn(3, 255)  
img_feat = torch.randn(3, 33)  
aud_feat = torch.randn(3, 17)  

encoder = Mult_Mod_Att_Fus(txt_dim=255, img_dim=33, aud_dim=17, fus_dim=128, num_heads=4)
fused_rep = encoder(txt_feat, img_feat, aud_feat)

print("Fused representation shape:", fused_rep.shape)  # Expected: (3, 128)
```

The [PyTorch](/community/tutorials/pytorch-101-advanced) model combines text, image, and audio data through self-attention to achieve multimodal fusion. The model uses distinct linear layers to project each modality into a shared fusion space. The transformed features get stacked together, resulting in a single unified input tensor. Through multi-head self-attention, the model enables various modalities to interact dynamically and influence each other.

The fully connected layer transforms the aligned feature output into a fused representation with dimensions (_batch\_size_, _fusion\_dim_). In the example usage, the model receives random input tensors for text with 255 dimensions, image with 33 dimensions, and audio with 17 dimensions before generating a fused representation of 128 dimensions for each batch sample.

[Applications of Multimodal AI](#applications-of-multimodal-ai)[](#applications-of-multimodal-ai)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By combining different modalities, multimodal AI systems can carry out tasks with human-like context awareness. This makes them effective for real-world uses like autonomous vehicles, speech recognition, emotion analysis, and generative AI applications for text and image synthesis.

### [Autonomous Vehicles](#autonomous-vehicles)[](#autonomous-vehicles)

The use of self-driving cars demonstrates how multimodal AI operates effectively in practical applications. The operation of autonomous vehicles depends on data inputs from numerous sensors which include camera images, [LiDAR](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html#:~:text=Lidar%20%E2%80%94%20Light%20Detection%20and%20Ranging,Lighthouse%2C%20Dry%20Tortugas%2C%20Florida.) point clouds, radar signals, and GPS information. Data fusion from different sensor streams enables vehicles to accurately perceive their surroundings. Generative AI can improve autonomous vehicle technology by predicting future events, such as pedestrians stepping off sidewalks.

### [Speech Recognition](#speech-recognition)[](#speech-recognition)

Traditional speech recognition models transform spoken audio signals into written text. Multimodal AI can build upon traditional speech recognition by adding context, such as lip reading or textual metadata.

If [lip reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_reading) and audio data are used in noisy environments, they can achieve much better results. This can illustrate how multimodal AI works in practical applications. Additionally, multimodal generative AI models can transcribe speech while generating related summary text and bullet points that integrate visual representations such as charts or diagrams.

### [**Emotion Recognition**](#emotion-recognition)[](#emotion-recognition)

To understand human emotions we need to observe subtle signals in facial expressions (visual), voice tone (audio), and textual content (when it exists). Robust emotion recognition emerges from multimodal AI systems that combine multiple signals. A video conferencing application might identify if a user shows signs of confusion or disengagement which would cause the presenter to clarify specific topics.

### [**AI Models for Text and Image Generation**](#ai-models-for-text-and-image-generation)[](#ai-models-for-text-and-image-generation)

Text-to-image generation includes models that integrate both textual and visual prompts. Let’s consider that you have a partial sketch of your design with a written explanation describing your desired look.

By merging inputs from different modalities, multimodal AI systems can produce a range of high-quality design alternatives. This will help fill creative gaps across fashion, interior design, and advertising sectors.

Integrating entire [knowledge graphs](/community/conceptual-articles/ai-hallucinations-with-rag-and-knowledge-graphs) or large text corpora with visual data enables the creation of outputs that are both contextually rich and well-grounded. An AI system can read complete architectural books while analyzing thousands of building images to generate innovative designs.

[Challenges in Multimodal Training](#challenges-in-multimodal-training)[](#challenges-in-multimodal-training)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the promise of multimodal generative AI is immense, several challenges still impede widespread adoption:

![Image](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/010AI-ML/2024/Shaoni/Adrien/25-feb/6-mml.png)

-   **Data Alignment**: Multimodal datasets require careful curation and alignment to ensure that texts correspond to their respective images or audio clips. Improper data alignment leads to training inconsistencies and unreliable performance results.
-   **Model Complexity**: Multimodal AI architecture needs more parameters than single-modality models. This increases GPU resource demands and extends training time.
-   **Computing Power Requirements**: The expense associated with training multimodal models on a large scale makes this technology available only to organizations with substantial financial resources and research labs.
-   **Interpretability**: Gaining insight into the decision-making process of multimodal systems is more complex than analyzing unimodal models. The need to track each modality’s input makes it much harder to interpret model operations.
-   **Limited Standardized Benchmark**s: Although benchmarks for text and vision tasks are available, comprehensive multimodal AI applications remain new. This creates challenges in consistently comparing models.

The industry is developing stronger data curation pipelines, and efficient model architectures(such as [sparse transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509v1) and [mixture-of-experts](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/rajbhandari22a/rajbhandari22a.pdf)) with improved alignment strategies to address existing challenges. Successfully addressing these challenges remains essential to progress in multimodal deep learning.
