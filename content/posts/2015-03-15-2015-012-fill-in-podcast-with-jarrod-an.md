# 2015-012-Fill In podcast with Jarrod and Lee

<br/>

<br/>
Mr. Boettcher went on vacation and was volunteering for Austin Bsides this week, and I needed to do a podcast, so I enlisted the aid of Lee Brotherston and Jarrod Frates discuss some important topics.  We discuss the seemingly short talent pool for IT/IS positions.  We talk about the ROWHAMMER vulnerability and how it may affect your organization. Additionally, we talk about how the NTP protocol is being maintained by one person and what can be done to help with that, as it is a critical piece of Internet Infrastructure, and finally, we figure out why PGP/GPG is not user-friendly, and if there are ways to make it better, or if it needs to be replaced permanently.
