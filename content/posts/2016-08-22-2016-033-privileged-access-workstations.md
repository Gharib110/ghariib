# 2016-033 Privileged Access Workstations PAWs and how to implement them

<br/>

<br/>
Bill V. (@blueteamer on Twitter) and was the 1st of a series we like to call "2nd Chances: Rejected Talks". Bill had a talk that was rejected initially at DerbyCon (later accepted after someone else cancelled)  Here is the synopsis of his talk that you can now see at DerbyCon:

Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) are hardened admin workstations implemented to protect privileged accounts. In this talk I will discuss my lessons learned while deploying PAWs in the real world as well as other techniques I've used to limit exposure to credential theft and lateral movement. I hope to show fellow blue teamers these types of controls are feasible to implement, even in small environments.
