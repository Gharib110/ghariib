In honor of the five new states that legalized marijuana in this week's US elections, DEF CON Movie Night is showing the original 'Reefer Madness'. First released in1936, this anti-marijuana propaganda piece began as a church-funded film called 'Tell Your Children'. Designed to scare kids away from 'jazz cigarettes', the plot revolves wide-eyed teens lurching from innocence to utter depravity after a brief dalliance with what was likely some very weak-sauce Depression-era weed. Unintentional hilarity follows.  
  
The filmmakers overplay their hand to such an extent that the film probably encouraged more stoners than it inhibited, and it became a cult favorite of pot enthusiasts and connoisseurs of badfilm in the 70s and inspired a remake in the 2000s.  
  
We'll also be showing the (very) short film created in 1942 by the US government to encourage the growing of hemp. 'Hemp for Victory' was produced and for many years disavowed by the Department of Agriculture, and while it's not as riotously funny as 'Reefer Madness' it is not without charm. It's also pretty informative about the business side of a pretty remarkable family of plants.  
  
Join us for some laughs and a pinch of agriculture propaganda at 8pm Pacific on Saturday Nov 7 in the DEF CON Discord ([https://discord.gg/defcon/](https://discord.gg/DEFCON/)) in movie-night-text and movie-night-voice. [Download iCal](html/links/ics/DC MovieNight - Reefer Madness.ics)
