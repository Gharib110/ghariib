People around the world count on Signal for things as simple as sharing moments of celebration like a graduation or as high stakes as coordinating a protest. We’ve got your back no matter what! As we’ve seen in recent times from moments of civil unrest to demonstrations for democracy, people turn to Signal for private and even lifesaving communications.

Day in and day out, the team at Signal is working to keep your chats, voice, and video calls safe and private. It’s our mission.

As a nonprofit, our whole focus is building safe, secure communication tools for you.
