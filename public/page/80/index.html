		<p>Confidential computing strengthens application security by providing isolation, encryption and attestation so data remains protected while in use. By integrating these security features with a scalable, high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, organizations can adopt a defense-in-depth approach. This is especially critical for regulated industries handling sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and financial information, enabling them to leverage AI with confidence.In this article, we expl</p>

<p>Every day, I talk with security leaders who are navigating a critical balancing act. On one side, their organizations are moving faster than ever, adopting transformative technologies like generative AI and expanding their cloud footprint. On the other, they‚Äôre working to maintain strong security controls and visibility across an increasingly complex landscape. We all know that adding more tools and controls isn‚Äôt sustainable. We need a different approach to security at scale.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It‚Äôs exciting to see the continued momentum of 5G in transforming industries. Do you remember when 3G and 4G first came into the picture? They unlocked opportunities for mobile broadband and video streaming. Now, 5G makes it possible for businesses like yours to connect more devices, enhance decision-making, improve operational efficiency and drive growth.</p>
<p>However, the real breakthrough is in the convergence of technologies that are coming together to supercharge 5G business transformation across our most critical infrastructure, industrial businesses and governments. This includes 5G coming of age at the same time as AI, bringing together lightning fast connectivity with intelligence. At the same time, IT and OT are coming together, creating new opportunities for efficiency, productivity and agility between traditionally siloed systems.</p>

		<p>Cloud platforms like <strong>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud</strong>, alongside <strong>Microsoft 365 (M365)</strong>, have become the backbone of modern business operations. While these tools offer unparalleled scalability and collaboration, they also introduce unique security challenges. Misconfigurations, weak security settings, and overlooked compliance gaps can expose sensitive data, disrupt operations, and attract attackers.</p>
<p>This growing complexity demands more than traditional security approaches. That‚Äôs where <strong>MSI‚Äôs Cloud and M365 Configuration Review Services</strong> come in‚Äîhelping organizations identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and build stronger, more resilient cloud environments.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Modern software development emphasizes speed and agility, making efficient testing crucial. DORA research reveals that elite teams thrive with both high performance and reliability. They can achieve 127x faster lead times, 182x more deployments per year, 8x lower change failure rates and most impressively, 2,293x faster recovery times after incidents. The secret sauce is they ‚Äúshift left.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Shift-Left is a practice that moves integration activities like testing and security earlier in the development cycle, allowing teams to detect and fix issues before they reach production. By incorporating local and integration tests early, developers can prevent costly late-stage defects, accelerate development, and improve software quality.¬†</p>

		<p>Critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-25291 + CVE-2025-25292) were discovered in ruby-saml up to version 1.17.0. In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll shed light on how these vulnerabilities that rely on a parser differential were uncovered.</p>
<p>The post Sign in as anyone: Bypassing SAML SSO authentication with parser differentials appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-25291 + CVE-2025-25292) were discovered in ruby-saml up to version 1.17.0. Attackers who are in possession of a single valid signature that was created with the key used to validate SAML responses or assertions of the targeted organization can use it to construct SAML assertions themselves and are in turn able to log in as any user. In other words, it could be used for an account takeover attack. Users of ruby-saml should update to version 1.18.0. References to libraries making use of ruby-saml (such as omniauth-saml) need also be updated to a version that reference a fixed version of ruby-saml.</p>
