# Indian Government Breached Massive Amount of Critical Vulnerabilities

<br/>

<br/>
Indian Government Breach, Massive Amount of Critical Vulnerabilities Executive Summary Sakura Samurai knew that the Indian Government operated an RVDP (Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program). Jackson Henry put a list together of initial assets in scope for Sakura Samurai to legally test. Robert Willis reported that he had found sensitive data and was able to breach police assets. Jackson Henry was working in the enumeration processes with his friend, Zultan Holder \[not an active Sakura Samurai member\] and identified a slew of various attack vectors, immediately resulting in the exposure of many pairs of credentials for databases and other pertinent applications.
