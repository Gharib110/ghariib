# How to talk your way in anywhere Hacking Humans Goes to the Movies

<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for joining us for the latest episode of our fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Co-hosts Dave Bittner and Joe Carrigan are joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave, Joe and Rick are watching Dave's and Rick's scene picks. They watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then the team deconstructs what they saw. Grab a bowl of popcorn and join us for some Hollywood scams and frauds. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Dave's clip from the television show "Key & Peele" Rick's pick from "Sneakers"
