# SAFE MODE Content is Live

<br/>

<br/>
![DEF CON Safe Mode DT Welcome image](https://defcon.org/images/defcon-safemode/post-images/dt-welcome.jpg)  

To get the party started, we’re releasing a bunch of the content early. Over on the [media server](https://media.defcon.org/DEF CON 28/), we’ve got all of the main stage talks and materials, the soundtrack, demo labs, art, CTF, music - take what you like. Completists out there, we see you. There’s a very thicc torrent file as well. Take some time to watch the talks you’ve been waiting for at your leisure, so you’re ready for the live Q&A sessions starting Thursday. This will be the first DEF CON where you won’t have to pick between main stage talks and the rest of the show, so take advantage. If you had plans, we apologize.  
  
So close now!
