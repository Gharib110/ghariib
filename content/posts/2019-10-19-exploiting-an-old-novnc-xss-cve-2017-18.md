# Exploiting an old noVNC XSS CVE-2017-18635 in OpenStack

<br/>

<br/>
**TL;DR:** noVNC had a **DOM-based XSS** that allowed attackers to use a malicious VNC  
server to inject JavaScript code inside the web page.  
As OpenStack uses noVNC and its patching system doesn’t update third parties’ software, fully-updated OpenStack installations may still be vulnerable.

Introduction
------------

Last week I was testing an **OpenStack** infrastructure during a [Penetration Test](https://www.shielder.com/servizi/sicurezza-informatica/penetration-test.php).  
OpenStack is a _free_ and _open-source_ software platform for cloud computing, where you can manage and deploy virtual servers and other resources.  
OpenStack is a huge piece of software, made of many different “_modules_ ”, as can be seen in the [official Github repository](https://github.com/openstack/openstack).
