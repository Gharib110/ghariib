# Imposter commits vulnerability in GitHub Actions

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability in GitHub Actions allows bypassing workflow settings using commits from forked repositories (rather than commits of the main action repo). This "imposter commits" issue can potentially introduce untrusted code into CI/CD pipelines, posing a risk to the security of the software supply chain. The vulnerability stems from GitHub's handling of forked repositories and how commits are shared between forks and parent repositories. A partial solution to this was GitHub prohibiting partial commit references in workflows, however, no full solution exists currently.
