# Bare Metal Backup A Comprehensive Guide

<br/>

<br/>
[**Introduction**](#introduction)[](#introduction)
--------------------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, hardware failure, cyberattacks, or unexpected system crashes aren’t just an inconvenience but a major risk and can bring business operations down. Hence, having a reliable backup is not the need but is a major necessity. This is where bare metal backup comes in. Unlike traditional backups that only save files or applications, bare metal backup captures everything—your operating system, settings, and entire system state—so you can restore it exactly as it was, without missing anything. But how does it really work, and why is it becoming the go-to solution for businesses? Let’s break it down in simple terms. The global bare metal cloud market has shown remarkable growth, expanding from USD 7.14 billion to USD 8.96 billion between 2022 and 2023. This swift expansion shows a 25% [annual growth rate](https://www.baculasystems.com/blog/bare-metal-backup-recovery/), and experts predict the market will reach USD 22.13 billion by 2027. These figures not only show a rise in the demand for bare metal but also its role in securing tomorrow’s operations.

[**What is a Bare Metal Server?**](#what-is-a-bare-metal-server)[](#what-is-a-bare-metal-server)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let us first understand Bare Metal Server. A [**bare metal**](/products/bare-metal-gpu) server refers to a physical hardware system or server that operates without any virtualization layer or intermediary software, such as a hypervisor. This means the operating system (OS) runs directly on the hardware, providing access to all hardware resources like CPU, RAM, and storage. Bare metal systems are often used for high-performance computing, intensive workloads, or when specific hardware-level control is required. It can be understood as renting the whole car to yourself instead of sharing it with others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bare metal backup refers to creating a complete copy of a system—including the operating system, applications, configurations, and data—at the hardware level. During unlikely events, this backup enables the system to be restored to its original state on similar or entirely new hardware. A few key features of Bare Metal Backup are as follows:

### [**Key Features:**](#key-features)[](#key-features)
