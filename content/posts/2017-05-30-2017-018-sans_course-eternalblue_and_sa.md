# 2017-018-SANS_course-EternalBlue_and_Samba_vulnerabilities-DerbyCon contest details

<br/>

<br/>
We discuss SANS courses, including the one I just took (SEC504). How did I do in class? You can listen to the show and find out.

Since it's been a few weeks, we also discuss all the interesting WannaCry reports, the ease at which this vulnerability was exploited, and why would a company allow access to SMB (tcp port 445) from the Internet?

We discuss some upcoming training that we are holding starting 14 June. Ms. Sunny Wear will be doing 3 sessions discussing the use of Burp, and showing how to exploit various web application vulnerabilities.  Details are in the show notes and in our Slack Channel.

**Ms. Sunny Wear is doing a web app security class**

**Starts June 14th at 1900 Eastern (1600 Pacific, 2300 UTC)** 

**Sign up for the class at the $20 dollar Patreon level (if you plan on attending)**

**Sign up for immediate video access at the $10 Patreon level (cannot attend class, but want to follow along)**

**Everyone will have access to the Slack Channel to follow along with the class, ask questions, etc (join our #slack channel for more information)**

 SHOW NOTES:

SANS experience

Pity Quincenera - I (bryan) sucked

Need more experience

Speed kills (I (bryan) got flustered and I shutdown) you took speed?

No Kali - was surprised, until I thought of why :D

Was not helpful to my team (jacek, ryan, Michael C., David)

John Strand was phenomenal

Frank Kim was great

The audio was not, unfortunately :(

Samba/SMB (port 445) vulns

Use case for having it exposed?

\*\*\*\* OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS \*\*\*\*\*

What does that say about the company?

No security team, or the security team is ineffectual about telling people about the risks?

What

MS17-010 is the new MS08-067
