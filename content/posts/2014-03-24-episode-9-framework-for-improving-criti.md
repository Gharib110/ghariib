# Episode 9 Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we got into some discussion about frameworks, and the different types of frameworks available (regulatory, "best practice", and process improvement)

We also looked at the new "**Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity**" ratified and released last month.

Does it meet with our high expectations? You'll just have to listen and find out.
