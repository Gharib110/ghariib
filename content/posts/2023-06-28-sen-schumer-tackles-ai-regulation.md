# Sen Schumer Tackles AI Regulation

<br/>

<br/>
Sen. Schumer (D-N.Y.) has announced an [ambitious plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/21/ai-regulation-us-senate-chuck-schumer/?utm_source=pocket_saves) to produce a bipartisan AI regulation program in a matter of months. [Jordan Schneider](https://rhg.com/) admires the project; I’m more skeptical. The rest of our commentators, [Chessie Lockhart](https://www.strausscenter.org/person/francesca-lockhart/) and [Michael Ellis,](https://www.heritage.org/staff/michael-j-ellis) also weigh in on AI issues. Chessie lays out the case against panicking over existential AI threats, this week [canvassed in the MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/19/1075140/how-existential-risk-became-biggest-meme-in-ai/). I suggest that anyone complaining that the EU or China is getting ahead of the U.S. in AI regulation ([lookin’ at you, Sen. Warner](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/15/senate-intelligence-chair-china-leads-the-world-on-ai-rules-00102168?utm_source=pocket_saves)!) doesn’t quite understand the race we’re running. Jordan explains the difficulty the U.S. faces in [trying to keep China from surprising us](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-grapples-with-potential-threats-from-chinese-ai-7d1f2e70?mod=djemalertNEWS&utm_source=pocket_saves) in AI.

Michael catches us up on [Canada’s ill-advised effort](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/showdown-looming-as-online-news-bill-is-about-to-become-law) to force Google and Meta to pay Canadian media whenever a user links to a Canadian story. Meta has already said it would rather end such links. The end result could be that even more Canadian news gets filtered through American media, hardly a popular outcome north of the border.

Speaking of ill-advised regulatory initiatives, Michael and I comment on Australia’s [threatening Twitter with a fine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/06/22/australia-elon-musk-twitter-hate/?utm_source=pocket_saves) for allowing too much hate speech on the platform post-Elon.  

Chessie gives an overview of the [Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange Act or the DELETE Act](https://therecord.media/delete-act-reintroduced-congress-data-brokers), a relatively modest bipartisan effort to regulate data brokers’ control of personal data. Michael and I talk about the [growing tension](https://therecord.media/delete-act-reintroduced-congress-data-brokers) between EU member states with real national security tasks to complete and the Brussels establishment, which has enjoyed a 70-year holiday from national security history and expects the next 70 to be more of the same. The latest conflict is over [how much leeway to give member states](https://therecord.media/european-council-agrees-on-reduced-journalist-protections) when they feel the need to plant spyware on journalists’ phones. Remarkably, both sides think the government should have such leeway; the fight is over how much.  

Michael and I are surprised that the BBC feels obliged to ask, “[Why is it so rare to hear about Western cyber-attacks?](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65977742)” Because, BBC, the agencies carrying out those attacks are on our side and mostly respect rules we support.

In updates and quick hits:

-   I bring listeners up to date on how things turned out for the lawyers who filed a ChatGPT-hallucinated brief in federal court: [Not well](https://www.law360.com/technology/articles/1691963?nl_pk=ba937d35-603d-43df-b094-ca4dcdcccf39&nlaidx=0&nlsidx=0&utm_source=pocket_saves). 
    
-   Chessie flags the creation of a new Justice Department section in the National Security Division: [Natsec Cyber](https://therecord.media/doj-national-security-division-new-cybercrimes-section)
    
-   Chessie also welcomes the growing recognition, [some of it in cold, hard cash](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.axios.com/2023/06/23/google-cybersecurity-clinics-20m-investment__;!!ApXA7kLm!yiS3lWc_uj93P-lE0PB_O_hh4vXIAvVzNTT_YBF-eoFWxG9i7udNt0mWc0THay-mGFi8sEkLR_fKGSkzNw6NUuoNUD9mwQcwrw$), for [cyber security clinics](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.wired.com/story/ut-austin-cybersecurity-clinic-311/__;!!ApXA7kLm!yiS3lWc_uj93P-lE0PB_O_hh4vXIAvVzNTT_YBF-eoFWxG9i7udNt0mWc0THay-mGFi8sEkLR_fKGSkzNw6NUuoNUD-D6XR9ig$).
