Signal 3.0 is [now available in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8):

-   iPad support has arrived. Set up your favorite tablet as a linked device.
-   Forward messages between threads. Editing support lets you amend, extend, append, explain what you intend, or tie up loose ends before you hit send.
-   Built-in support for video trimming can help any clip turn into a highlight.
-   Tap on someoneâ€™s avatar in a group conversation to quickly message or call them. While the group agonizes over dinner plans, subtly exert your influence by making a case for your favorite restaurant in one-on-one conversations.
-   Jump between threads and survey your message landscape (in landscape) with a horizontal inbox/conversation view on larger devices.
