# 2015-011- Why does BeEF and metadata tracking keep I2P developers up at night

<br/>

<br/>
In our continuing discussion with Jeff and "Str4d", we got right to the heart of the matter: Privacy and anonymity.

If you're trying to remain anonymous, what steps do the devs of I2P use to keep themselves as anonymous as possible.  We also touch on what the "Browser Exploitation Framework", and why it scares the heck out of Jeff.

Finally, I ask them if there is any real 'good' sites on I2P, because of how the media seems to latch on to any story where we hear the bad things of any anonymizing network, is there a way we can improve the image of anonymizing networks.
