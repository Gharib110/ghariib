# DerbyCon report and Shellshock news

<br/>

<br/>
We went a little off the beaten path this week. I wanted to talk to Mr. Boettcher about his experience at DerbyCon, and we ended up having another friend of ours who also attended DerbyCon, Jarrod Frates, join us for a bit of discussion. We discussed several talks, and even spent a little bit of time talking about ShellShock and it's larger implications for those programs that are ubiquitous, yet are not being audited, like bash.  (The llama graphic will make more sense next week...) :)
