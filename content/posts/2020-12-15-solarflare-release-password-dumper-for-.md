# SolarFlare Release Password Dumper for SolarWinds Orion

<br/>

<br/>
TL;DR Here are the concerns I have regarding the SolarWinds/FireEye breach: The accounts stored in an organization’s SolarWinds Orion may be underestimated. I recently did a pentest for a firm that had over 200 credentials stored in their SolarWinds Orion database, but only 15 showed in the interface (the SolarWinds credential interface is complicated with sections for each connection type and different panes for each, it may also not properly delete credentials from the database when “removed” from the interface, I am unsure).
