DEF CON movie night rolls on with ‘Primer’. Joins us on the [DC discord](https://discord.gg/defcon) Saturday 8pm PST for what has to be the most brainmelting time travel movie that could possibly be shot for $7000. Bring a cork board and a few different colors of yarn. We’ll be waiting for you in the movie-night-text channel.
