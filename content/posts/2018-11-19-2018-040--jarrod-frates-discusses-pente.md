“Skittering Through Networks”

Ms. Berlin in Germany - How’d it go?

TinkerSec’s story:  [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1063423110513418240.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1063423110513418240.html)

Takeaways

Blue Team:

\- Least Privilege Model

\- Least Access Model

    “limited remote access to only a small number of IT personnel”

“This user didn't need Citrix, so her Citrix linked to NOTHING”

“They limited access EVEN TO LOCAL ADMINS!”

\- Multi-Factor Authentication

\- Simple Anomaly Rule Fires

    “Finance doesn’t use Powershell”

\- Defense in Depth

    “moving from passwords to pass phrases…”

“Improper disposal of information assets”

Red Team:

\- Keep Trying

\- Never Assume

\- Bring In Help

\- Luck Favors the Prepared

\- Adapt and Overcome

  
  

Before the Test

-   Talk it over with stakeholders: Reasons, goals, schedules
-   Report is the product: Get samples
-   Who, what, when, where, why, how
-   Talk to testers (and clients, if you can find them)
-   -   Ask questions
    -   Look for past defensive experience and understanding of your needs
    -   -   Bonus points if they interview you as a client
    -   Red flags: Pwning is all they talk about, they set no-crash guarantees, send info in the clear
-   Define the scope: Test type(s), inclusions, exclusions, permissions, accounts
-   Test in ‘test/dev’, NOT PROD
-   Social Engineering: DO THIS. Yes, you’re vulnerable. DO IT ANYWAY.

During the Test

-   Comms: Keep in contact with the testers
-   -   Status reports (if the engagement is long enough)
    -   Have an established method for escalation
    -   Have an open communication style --brbr (WeBrBrs)
-   Ask questions, but let the testers do their jobs
-   Be available and ready to address critical events
-   Keep critical stakeholders informed
-   Watch your network: things break, someone else may be getting in, capture packets(?)

After the Test

-   Getting Results:
-   -   Report delivered securely
    -   Initial summary: How far did they get?
    -   Actual report
    -   -   Written for multiple levels
        -   No obvious copy/paste
        -   Read, understand, provide feedback, and get revised version
-   Next steps:
-   -   Don’t blame anyone unnecessarily
    -   Start planning with stakeholders on fixes
    -   Contact vendors, educate staff
-   Reacting to report
-   Sabotaging your test
-   Future testing
