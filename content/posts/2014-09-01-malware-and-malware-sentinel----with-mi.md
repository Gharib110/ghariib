# Malware and Malware Sentinel -- with Michael Gough Pt1

<br/>

<br/>
Brian and I managed to get an interview with Michael Gough. If you remember, Michael was on to discuss Malware infections back in February, and we decided it was time to check up on him and his newly named 'Malware Sentinel'. This is part 1, where we discuss some of the recent malware infections, and where you need to look for new file creation, and what you can be looking for in your windows logs that are excellent indicators of malware compromise.
