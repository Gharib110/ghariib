[How to Deploy DeepSeek R1 on DigitalOcean](#how-to-deploy-deepseek-r1-on-digitalocean)[](#how-to-deploy-deepseek-r1-on-digitalocean)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article compares three ways to deploy **DeepSeek R1**, a cost-effective large language model (LLM), on DigitalOcean. Each approach offers distinct trade-offs in **setup complexity**, **security**, **fine-tuning**, and **system-level customization**. By the end of this guide, you’ll know which method best matches your technical experience and project requirements.

[Overview](#overview)[](#overview)
----------------------------------

**[DeepSeek R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120)** is a versatile LLM for text generation, Q&A, and chatbot development. On DigitalOcean, you can deploy DeepSeek R1 in one of three ways:

1.  **Approach A: [GenAI Platform (Serverless)](/products/gen-ai)**  
    A platform-based solution that minimizes DevOps overhead and delivers quick results but doesn’t support native fine-tuning.
    
2.  **Approach B: DigitalOcean + Hugging Face Generative Service (IaaS)**  
    Offers a prebuilt Docker environment and API token, supports multiple containers on a [GPU Droplet](/products/gpu-droplets), and allows training or fine-tuning.
    
3.  **Approach C: Dedicated [GPU Bare Metal](/products/bare-metal-gpu) + Ollama (IaaS)**  
    It provides complete control over the OS, security configurations, and model fine-tuning but is more complex.
    

[Using GenAI Platform (Serverless)](#using-genai-platform-serverless)[](#using-genai-platform-serverless)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![GenAI Platform](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739343944/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/genai-deepseek.png)

The [DigitalOcean GenAI Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/details/pricing/#open-source-models) uses a **usage-based** pricing model:

-   **Token-Based Billing**: You pay for both input and output tokens (tracked per thousand tokens, displayed per million tokens).
-   **Open-Source Models**: For instance, DeepSeek-R1-distill-llama-70B is **$0.99** per million tokens. Lower-priced models start at $0.198 per million tokens.
-   **Commercial Models**: If you bring your own API token (e.g., Anthropic), you follow the provider’s rates.
-   **Knowledge Bases**: Additional fees for indexing tokens and vector storage.
-   **Guardrails**: $3.00 per million tokens if you enable jailbreak or content moderation.
-   **Functions**: Billed under [DigitalOcean Functions](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions/) pricing.

**Playground Limit**: The GenAI playground is free but limited to **10,000 tokens** per day, per team (covering both input and output).

[Using GPU Droplets](#using-gpu-droplets)[](#using-gpu-droplets)
----------------------------------------------------------------

![gpu-droplet-deepseek](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739343944/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/gpu-droplet-hugs-deepseek.png)

For **Approach B** (HUGS on IaaS) and **Approach C** (Ollama on IaaS), you’ll provision a [GPU Droplet](/products/gpu-droplets). Refer to [Announcing GPU Droplets](/blog/announcing-gpu-droplets) for current pricing. At publication:

-   **Starting at $2.99/GPU/hr on-demand** (subject to change).
-   Additional fees (like data egress or storage) may apply.
-   You’re responsible for OS-level security, scaling, and patches.

**Info:** Deploy DeepSeek R1, the open-source advanced reasoning model that excels at text generation, summarization, and translation tasks. As one of the most computationally efficient open-source LLMs available, you’ll get high performance while keeping infrastructure costs low with DigitalOcean’s GPU Droplets.

[Security and Maintenance](#security-and-maintenance)[](#security-and-maintenance)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Approach A (GenAI Serverless)**
    
    -   Security patches and maintenance are handled automatically.
    -   Optional guardrails or KBs incur token-based charges.
-   **Approach B (HUGS on a GPU Droplet)**
    
    -   You manage OS security, Docker environments, and firewall rules.
    -   The default token-based authentication is provided for the LLM endpoint.
-   **Approach C (Ollama on a GPU Droplet)**
    
    -   You take on the highest level of control and responsibility: OS security, firewall, usage monitoring.
    -   Ideal for compliance or custom configurations but requires more DevOps work.
-   **Performance Benchmarks?**
    
    -   No official speed metrics or SLAs are currently published. Performance depends on GPU size, data load, and specific workflows.
    -   If you need help optimizing performance, reach out to our solution architects. We may share future articles on benchmarking techniques.

[Approach A: GenAI Platform (Serverless)](#approach-a-genai-platform-serverless)[](#approach-a-genai-platform-serverless)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use DigitalOcean’s [GenAI Platform](/products/gen-ai) for a fully managed DeepSeek R1 deployment without provisioning GPU Droplets or handling OS tasks. Through a user-friendly UI, you can quickly create a chatbot, Q&A flow, or basic RAG setup.

### [When to Choose the GenAI Platform](#when-to-choose-the-genai-platform)[](#when-to-choose-the-genai-platform)

-   You have limited DevOps experience or prefer not to manage servers.
-   You need a quick AI assistant (e.g., a WordPress plugin or FAQ bot).
-   You don’t plan to train or fine-tune the model with private data.

### [Example Scenario: Chelsea’s Local Café Blog](#example-scenario-chelsea-s-local-cafe-blog)[](#example-scenario-chelsea-s-local-cafe-blog)

![chelsea](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739273832/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/chelsea-case.jpg)

Chelsea hosts a WordPress blog for her café, posting menu updates and community events. She’s comfortable with site hosting but not OS administration:

-   She wants a chatbot to answer questions about open hours, menu specials, or local events.
-   Guardrails can be added later if she faces problematic content.
-   The GenAI Platform demands minimal server management, making it an easy choice.

### [Not Suitable When](#not-suitable-when)[](#not-suitable-when)

-   You need **[fine-tuning](/resources/articles/fine-tuning)** or domain-specific training.
-   You must meet strict security needs (private networking, advanced OS rules).
-   You plan to run multiple microservices or intensive tasks on a single server.

[Approach B: DigitalOcean + Hugging Face Generative Service (HUGS)](#approach-b-digitalocean-hugging-face-generative-service-hugs)[](#approach-b-digitalocean-hugging-face-generative-service-hugs)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This approach suits developers who want a [GPU Droplet](/products/gpu-droplets) based solution with **HUGS**, offering partial sysadmin freedoms (multi-container) and a straightforward **API token**. It supports training or fine-tuning locally.

### [When to Choose GPU Droplets](#when-to-choose-gpu-droplets)[](#when-to-choose-gpu-droplets)

-   You want a quicker path to an AI endpoint than a fully manual approach.
-   You aim to do some training or **fine-tuning** on the same GPU Droplet.
-   You know Docker basics and don’t mind partial server administration.

### [Example Scenario: CHFB Labs](#example-scenario-chfb-labs)[](#example-scenario-chfb-labs)

![CHFB](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739273832/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/chfb-case.jpg)

CHFB Labs builds fast Proofs of Concept for clients:

-   Some clients need domain-specific training or partial fine-tuning.
-   Extra Docker containers (e.g., staging or logging) can run on the same Droplet.
-   A default **access token** is included, avoiding custom auth code.

### [Not Suggested When](#not-suggested-when)[](#not-suggested-when)

-   You want a **serverless** approach (Approach A is simpler).
-   You require advanced OS-level tweaks (e.g., kernel modules).
-   You prefer a completely manual pipeline with zero pre-configuration.

[Approach C: GPU Droplets + Ollama](#approach-c-gpu-droplets-ollama)[](#approach-c-gpu-droplets-ollama)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use **Approach C** when you need full control over your [GPU Droplet](/products/gpu-droplets). You can configure OS security, implement custom domain training, and create your own endpoints, albeit with higher DevOps demands.

### [When to Choose GPU Droplets + Ollama](#when-to-choose-gpu-droplets-ollama)[](#when-to-choose-gpu-droplets-ollama)

-   You want to manage the OS, Docker, or orchestrators manually.
-   You need strict compliance or advanced custom rules (firewalls, specialized networking).
-   You plan to **fine-tune** DeepSeek R1 or run large-scale tasks.

### [Example Scenario: Mosaic Solutions](#example-scenario-mosaic-solutions)[](#example-scenario-mosaic-solutions)

![mosaic](https://res.cloudinary.com/iambigmomma/image/upload/v1739273832/blog/deepseek-deploy-3-ways/mosaic-case.jpg)

Mosaic Solutions provides enterprise analytics:

-   They store sensitive data and require encryption or specialized tooling.
-   They install [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) directly to manage exposure of DeepSeek R1.
-   They handle OS monitoring, usage logs, and custom performance tuning.

#### Not Ideal If

-   You dislike DevOps tasks or can’t manage OS-level security.
-   You want a single-click or minimal-effort deployment.
-   You only need a small chatbot with limited usage.
