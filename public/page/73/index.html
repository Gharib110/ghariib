		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion could allow for local code execution. VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion are all virtualization products that allow users to run virtual machines (VMs) on their computers. Successful exploitation of these vulnerability could allow for local code execution in the context of the administrator account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. </p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered Fortinet Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console.</li>
<li>FortiManager Cloud is a cloud-based service for centralized management, monitoring, and automation of Fortinet devices across multiple sites</li>
<li>FortiOS is the Fortinet’s proprietary Operation System which is utilized across multiple product lines.</li>
<li>FortiProxy is a secure web gateway that attempts to protects users against internet-borne attacks, and provides protection and visibility to the network against unauthorized access and threats.</li>
<li>FortiAnalyzer is a log management, analytics, and reporting platform that provides organizations with a single console to manage, automate, orchestrate, and respond, enabling simplified security operations, proactive identification and remediation of risks, and complete visibility of the entire attack landscape..</li>
<li>FortiSandbox 5.0 is a security solution that utilizes a combination of AI/ML, static, and dynamic analysis, inline blocking, and scalable virtual environments to identify, analyze, contextualize, prioritize, and protect against advanced threats in real-time.</li>
<li>FortiPAM provides privileged account management, session monitoring and management, and role-based access control to secure access to sensitive assets and mitigate data breaches.</li>
<li>FortiNDR is Fortinet&rsquo;s AI-driven Network Detection and Response (NDR) solution.</li>
<li>FortiWeb is a web application firewall (WAF) that protects web applications and APIs from attacks that target known and unknown exploits and helps maintain compliance with regulations.</li>
<li>FortiSIEM is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution from Fortinet that provides real-time infrastructure and user awareness for accurate threat detection, analysis, and reporting.</li>
<li>FortiIsolator is a Fortinet browser isolation solution that protects users from web-borne threats by creating a visual air gap between users&rsquo; browsers and websites, executing web content in a remote, disposable container.</li>
<li>Fortimail is like a Swiss army knife for email, consisting of anti-spam, anti-virus, content filtering, DLP and email archiving.</li>
<li>FortiClient is a Fabric Agent that delivers protection, compliance, and secure access in a single, modular lightweight client.</li>
<li>FortiADC is an application delivery controller (ADC) with advanced security features that help ensure application security, availability, and optimization, </li>
</ul>
<p>Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>Cybercriminals are spreading a stealer disguised as a &ldquo;cheat manager&rdquo; via YouTube videos to steal login credentials. Get the lowdown!</p>
<p>At the end of 2024, our experts discovered a new stealer called Arcane, which collects a wide range of data from infected devices. Now cybercriminals have taken it a step further by releasing ArcanaLoader — a downloader that claims to install cheats, cracks, and other “useful” gaming tools, but which actually infects devices with the Arcane stealer. Despite their lack of creativity in naming the loader, their distribution scheme is actually quite original.</p>

<p>A new ransomware operator named ‘Mora_001’ is exploiting two Fortinet vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to firewall appliances and deploy a custom ransomware strain dubbed SuperBlack.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities, both authentication bypasses, are CVE-2024–55591 and CVE-2025–24472, which Fortinet disclosed in January and February, respectively.</p>
<p>When Fortinet first disclosed CVE-2024–55591 on January 14, they confirmed it had been exploited as a zero-day, with Arctic Wolf stating it had been used in attacks since November 2024 to breach FortiGate firewalls.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Microsoft Threat Intelligence has uncovered a new variant of XCSSET, a sophisticated modular macOS malware that infects Xcode projects, in the wild during routine threat hunting. Its first known variant since 2022, this latest XCSSET malware features enhanced obfuscation methods, updated persistence mechanisms, and new infection strategies. These enhanced features help this malware family steal and exfiltrate files and system and user information, such as digital wallet data and notes, among others.</p>
