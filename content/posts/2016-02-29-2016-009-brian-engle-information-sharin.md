# 2016-009-Brian Engle Information Sharing and R-CISC

<br/>

<br/>
We've reached peak "Br\[i|y\]an" this week when we invited our friend Brian Engle on to discuss what his organization does. Brian is the Executive Director of the Retail Cyber Intelligence Sharing Center. 

"Created by retailers in response to the increased number and sophistication of attacks against the industry, the R-CISC provides another tool in retailers’ arsenal against cyber criminals by sharing leading practices and threat intelligence in a safe and secure way." -- R-CISC website

We discussed with Brian a bit of the history of the #R-CISC, and why his organization was brought into being. We ask Brian "How do you get companies who make billions of dollars a year to trust another competitor enough to share that they might have been compromised?" "And how do you keep the information sharing generic enough to not out a competitor by name, but still be actionable enough to spur members to do something to protect themselves?"

\*\*I (Bryan) apologize for the audio. I did what I could to clean it up. Seriously don't know what happened to screw it up that badly. I can only imagine it was bandwidth issues on my Skype connection\*\*
