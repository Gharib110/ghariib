# 2015-024 Is a good defense the best offense Interview w Mick Douglas

<br/>

<br/>
We had the opportunity to discuss with Mick Douglas the fact that there is a stigma of blue team always being on the losing end of the security. Is it because there are more tools for the pentesters or bad guys, or that it takes a massive IT budget to be secure? We don't believe so...Â Great insights into how a blue team can protect their network.
