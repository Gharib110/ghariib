Today I solved [FridaLab](http://rossmarks.uk/blog/fridalab/), a playground Android application for playing with [Frida](https://www.frida.re) and testing your skills.

The app is made of various challenges, with increasing difficulty, that will guide you through Frida’s potential.

This is a writeup with solutions to the challenges in FridaLab. We suggest the reader to take a look at it and try to solve it by itself before reading further.

In this writeup we will assume that the reader has a working environment with [_frida-server_](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases) already installed on the Android device and [_frida-tools_](https://pypi.org/project/frida-tools/) installed on the PC as well, since we will not cover those topics.
