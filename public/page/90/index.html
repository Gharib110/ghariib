		<p>Attackers are increasingly using more sophisticated methods to not just brute force their way into your sites but also simulate real user behavior for targeted harmful activity like account takeovers, credential stuffing, fake account creation, content scraping, and fraudulent transactions. They are no longer trying to simply take your website down or gain access to it, but rather cause actual business harm. There is also the increasing complexity added by attackers rotating IP addresses, routing through proxies, and using VPNs. In this evolving security landscape, meaningful analytics matter. Many traditional CAPTCHA solutions provide simplistic pass or fail trends on challenges without insights into traffic patterns or behavior. Cloudflare Turnstile aims to equip you with more than just basic trends, so you can make informed decisions and stay ahead of the attackers. </p>

A big Vivaldi web browser update is rolling out with a set of appreciable improvements long-time users will like, and would-be users may be tempted to try. Vivaldi 7.2 amps up its address bar logic to proffer more relevant results, faster. Search suggestions and search accuracy have been tweaked so that “finding what you need feels seamless”, according to Vivaldi Technologies’ CEO Jon von Tetzchner. Sticking with the speed theme, Vivaldi 7.2 is said to load pages faster—up to 2x as fast for some—thanks to some nifty optimised connection handling work on the backend that reduces latency on domain lookup.

	<div>
		<p>The FBI Denver Field Office has warned of an increasing number of scammy websites offering free online file converter services.</p>
<p>Instead of converting files, the tools actually load malware onto victims’ computers. The FBI warned specifically about that malware leading to ransomware attacks, but we’ve also seen similar sites that install browser hijackers, adware, and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).</p>
<p>The cybercriminals offer any kind of popular file conversion to attract victims, with the most common ones converting .doc to .pdf files and vice versa. There are also sites that offer to combine multiple images into one .pdf file.</p>

<p>The good news? IRS scams follow predictable patterns, and with a little awareness, you can spot the warning signs before falling victim. Let’s break down the most common tax scams and how you can safeguard your personal information this filing season. </p>
