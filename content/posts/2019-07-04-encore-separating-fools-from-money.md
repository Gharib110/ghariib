# Encore Separating fools from money

<br/>

<br/>
We're taking a break for the Independence Day holiday in the US, so enjoy this episode from the early days of our show. Dave shares a story of airport penetration testing with high degree of yuck-factor. Joe explores research on protecting passwords from social engineering. The catch-of-the-day comes courtesy of Graham Cluley's email spam box. Dave interviews Wired's Security Staff Writer Lily Hay Newman on her article tracking Nigerian email scammers.Â  Thanks to our show sponsor KnowBe4.
