Movie Night 1-16 - 'Charade'  
  
Let's all take a break from doomscrolling social media and treat ourselves to 90 or so minutes of the delightful effervescence of Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and Paris in the "lightly comedic mystery thriller" Charade. It's a beautifully shot film, with sparkling chemistry between the leads and a great score by Henry Mancini. You will be charmed.  
  
8PM PST Saturday in the [movie-night-text channel of discord.gg/defcon](https://discord.com/channels/708208267699945503/741067993617924227). Be there or be an equilateral rectangle.
