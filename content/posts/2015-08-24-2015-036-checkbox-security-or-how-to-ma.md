# 2015-036 Checkbox security or how to make companies go beyond compliance

<br/>

<br/>
Checkbox Security... checklists required to follow by compliance people and many security people have to fall in line, because they often have no choice.

But what if there was a way to use compliance requirements to get beyond the baseline of PCI/SOCII/HIPAA, and get to be more secure?

Megan Wu (@tottenkoph), Mr. Boettcher, and I spent a bit of time discussing just that. We discuss basic issues with compliance frameworks, how to get management to buy-in to more security, and even how you can get Compliance people to help without them knowing it.
