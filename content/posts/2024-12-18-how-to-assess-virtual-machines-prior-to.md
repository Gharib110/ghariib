Many software development shops deliver their product releases via virtual machine (VM) disk images. Whether deployed to a cloud environment, data center, or elsewhere, delivering safe and secure images is vital. If vulnerabilities, malware, or even unhardened binaries are present in a disk image delivered to customers, they are exposed to a significant degree of risk every time a VM is spun up using that image. If one of those customers ends up being compromised in a cyberattack due to the VM, both organizations may incur financial loss, as well as reputational damage.
