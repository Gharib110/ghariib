# A Comprehensive Guide to Byte Latent Transformer Architecture

<br/>

<br/>
[Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)
----------------------------------------------

Traditionally, [large language models](/resources/articles/large-language-models) (LLMs) heavily rely on the process of tokenization to process large sentences or phrases by dividing them into smaller tokens which are then passed to machine learning models to be processed. However, this approach comes with [biases in token compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871), sensitivity to noise, and challenges in multilingual processing. What if we could eliminate tokenization altogether and train models directly on raw bytes without sacrificing efficiency or performance?

In this article, we’ll dive into [Byte Latent Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871) which is the concept of a tokenizer free architecture or byte-level LLM architecture (BLT).

Unlike traditional models based on a fixed vocabulary of tokens, byte latent transformers dynamically group bytes into **latent patches**. This allows the model to allocate computational resources where they matter most, improving efficiency and robustness. Compared to the previous method, BLT models are better at handling noisy inputs, understanding character-level structures, and processing diverse languages more efficiently.

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)[](#prerequisites)
-------------------------------------------------

An understanding of the concepts mentioned below will help you better understand Byte Latent Transformers.

### [Tokenization in Language Models](#tokenization-in-language-models)[](#tokenization-in-language-models)

-   Traditional LLMs (e.g., GPT, Llama) use **subword tokenization** methods like **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** or **WordPiece** to break text into tokens before training.
-   Tokens are predefined chunks of words or characters that the model learns from.

### [Transformer Architecture Basics](#transformer-architecture-basics)[](#transformer-architecture-basics)

-   The [**transformer**](/community/tutorials/transformers-for-language-translation-classification) is the backbone of most modern LLMs. Key components include:
    -   **Self-attention** (how models focus on different parts of input data).
    -   **Feed-forward layers** (used for learning patterns in data).

### [Entropy in Language Models](#entropy-in-language-models)[](#entropy-in-language-models)

-   **Entropy** measures uncertainty in predictions. High entropy means the model is uncertain about the next byte/token, while low entropy means high confidence.
-   Used in BLT for dynamically deciding patch boundaries.

[What are Byte Latent Transformers?](#what-are-byte-latent-transformers)[](#what-are-byte-latent-transformers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Byte Latent Transformers (BLTs)** eliminate the need for predefined [tokenization](/community/tutorials/nlp-models-using-backtracking). Traditional AI models—like those used in [Llama 2](/community/tutorials/llama-2) and [Llama 3](/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-llama)—rely on tokenizers to break text into smaller units (tokens) before feeding them into the model. While this method works well, it can be limiting—especially when dealing with multiple languages or new types of data.

BLTs instead work with raw bytes and group them into “patches” instead of predefined tokens. This patch-based system allows the model to be more flexible and efficient, reducing the computational cost of processing text. Since larger patch sizes mean fewer processing steps, BLTs can scale up without dramatically increasing the training budget. This makes them particularly useful for handling large datasets and complex languages, while also improving inference speed.

Although BLTs are still being optimized, early results show they can match or even outperform traditional models at scale. As research continues, BLTs could pave the way for more efficient and universally adaptable AI models.

[What is Entropy Patching?](#what-is-entropy-patching)[](#what-is-entropy-patching)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s first break down what [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) in a BLT refers to. Entropy here is the level of uncertainty in the byte sequences being processed. In simple terms, it tells us how “uncertain” the next byte in a sequence is, based on the model’s prediction.

-   If the entropy is **high**, the model is uncertain about what the next byte will be.
-   If the entropy is **low**, the model is more confident about the next byte.

Entropy measures how much randomness or unpredictability is present in a sequence of bytes. In BLT, the entropy of a byte sequence impacts:

-   **Compression Efficiency**: Higher entropy means more unique patterns, making it harder to compress. Lower entropy means more predictable structures that can be represented efficiently.
-   **Model Complexity Control**: BLTs adapt computation based on entropy, determining when to invoke the **Latent Global Transformer** to reduce unnecessary processing.
-   **Representation Learning**: By capturing patterns in byte sequences, BLTs learn efficient representations that balance complexity and expressiveness.

[Entropy patching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10029) is a method used to decide where to split byte sequences into patches based on the uncertainty (entropy) of the next byte prediction. This approach helps dynamically determine boundaries between patches. Unlike traditional rule-based methods (such as splitting on whitespace), **entropy patching** leverages a **data-driven approach**, calculating entropy estimates to identify where the next byte prediction becomes uncertain or complex.

### [How is Entropy Used for Patch Boundaries?](#how-is-entropy-used-for-patch-boundaries)[](#how-is-entropy-used-for-patch-boundaries)

BLTs use a small **byte-level language model** (LM) to estimate the entropy of each byte in the sequence. This is done for each byte (`xi`), and it helps decide where to split the sequence into patches.

#### Equation for Entropy (H(xi))

The entropy (`H(xi)`) for each byte (`xi`) is calculated as follows:

![image](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/010AI-ML/2024/Shaoni/19-feb/equation.png)

The calculation allows the model to adaptively determine patch boundaries based on where the data is uncertain or complex. Also, by defining patch boundaries where there’s high entropy, BLTs reduce unnecessary computations for predictable parts of the data. The more uncertain the next byte is, the more likely it is that a new patch boundary will be created.

[Subword Tokenization in LLMs](#subword-tokenization-in-llms)[](#subword-tokenization-in-llms)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern large language models (LLMs)—including Llama 3—use [**subword tokenization**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subword-tokenization-in-nlp/) where the model breaks down text into smaller pieces (tokens). However, these pieces aren’t always full words. Instead, they can be parts of words, like syllables or even smaller fragments. The **tokenizer** does this by using a predefined set of pieces, or tokens, that it learned from the training data. These tokens are not dynamic; they come from a fixed list.

### [Patches vs. Tokens](#patches-vs-tokens)[](#patches-vs-tokens)

In contrast to tokens, **patches** are sequences of bytes that are grouped together **dynamically** during the model’s operation. This means that patches don’t follow a fixed vocabulary and can vary depending on the input. With **tokens**, the model doesn’t have direct access to the actual raw bytes (the basic units of data). But with patches, the model can directly handle the raw bytes and group them dynamically.

### [BLT’s Advantage Over Tokenization](#blt-s-advantage-over-tokenization)[](#blt-s-advantage-over-tokenization)

In [traditional tokenization models](https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/tokenization/), when you increase the vocabulary size (more tokens), the tokens tend to get larger. This reduces the number of processing steps the model needs to take, but also requires more computing power. **BLT changes this balance**: it allows for better flexibility in how the data is grouped and processed, making it more efficient in some cases.

### [How Does BLT Decide When to Split the Data?](#how-does-blt-decide-when-to-split-the-data)[](#how-does-blt-decide-when-to-split-the-data)

When BLTs are generating text, they decide whether the current data should be split into a new **patch** or not. This decision has to happen on the fly, based only on the data that has already been processed, without knowing what comes next. This is important because BLT works with a dynamic approach—it can’t peek ahead in the text to decide how to split it. It has to make that decision step by step, which is called **incremental patching**.

### [Why Doesn’t Tokenization Work the Same Way?](#why-doesn-t-tokenization-work-the-same-way)[](#why-doesn-t-tokenization-work-the-same-way)

In a typical tokenization system, the model doesn’t work incrementally. For instance, if you look at the start of a word and try to break it down into tokens, the model might split it differently based on what comes next in the word. This means tokenization can **change based on the future text**, which doesn’t meet the needs of an incremental process like BLT, where the model must decide without knowing future data.

[Architecture and Mechanisms: A Simple Breakdown](#architecture-and-mechanisms-a-simple-breakdown)[](#architecture-and-mechanisms-a-simple-breakdown)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Byte latent transformers consists of **three main components**:

1.  **Global Transformer Model** (Latent Global Transformer)
2.  **Local Encoder** (Transforms bytes into patches)
3.  **Local Decoder** (Converts patches back into bytes)

![image](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/010AI-ML/2024/Shaoni/19-feb/architecture.png)

Each of these components plays a crucial role in making BLT an efficient and scalable model for language processing.

### [1\. Global Transformer Model (Latent Global Transformer)](#1-global-transformer-model-latent-global-transformer)[](#1-global-transformer-model-latent-global-transformer)

-   This is the **main powerhouse** of the BLT. Itt processes sequences of patch representations rather than individual bytes.
-   Works **autoregressively**, meaning it predicts the next patch based on previous patches.
-   Uses a **block-causal attention mask**, which ensures the model only attends to the current and past patches, improving efficiency.
-   Since this is the most computationally expensive part, BLT **intelligently decides when to invoke it**, optimizing the compute cost based on input complexity.

### [2\. Local Encoder (Converting Bytes into Patches)](#2-local-encoder-converting-bytes-into-patches)[](#2-local-encoder-converting-bytes-into-patches)

-   This is a **smaller, lightweight transformer** responsible for converting raw bytes into patch representations.
-   Uses a **special cross-attention mechanism** to efficiently pool byte information into patches.
-   Incorporates **hash-based n-gram embeddings**, meaning it captures **patterns of multiple consecutive bytes** (3 to 8 bytes) to improve understanding.
-   Uses a **block-causal attention mask** within local regions, meaning each byte only attends to nearby bytes while forming patches.

### [3\. Local Decoder (Converting Patches back to Bytes)](#3-local-decoder-converting-patches-back-to-bytes)[](#3-local-decoder-converting-patches-back-to-bytes)

-   Another **small transformer**, but this one works in the opposite direction of the encoder.
-   Takes processed patch representations and **reconstructs** the original byte sequences.
-   Uses a **cross-attention mechanism** where **patch representations guide the byte-level generation**.
-   Ensures **high fidelity** in generating outputs by refining byte details within each patch.

### [How BLT Works Together](#how-blt-works-together)[](#how-blt-works-together)

1.  **Encoding Phase**:
    -   The **Local Encoder** groups bytes into patches by looking at patterns and compressing information efficiently.
    -   Hash-based n-gram embeddings help capture longer context without increasing computational cost.
2.  **Processing Phase**:
    -   The **Global Transformer** works on patch representations instead of raw bytes, making computation more efficient.
    -   Uses **adaptive patch sizing**, so it spends **more compute on complex text** and **less on predictable text**.
3.  **Decoding Phase**:
    -   The **Local Decoder** reconstructs the original byte sequence from the processed patches using cross-attention.

[Challenges](#challenges)[](#challenges)
----------------------------------------

While BLTs offer several advantages over traditional transformers, they also come with some limitations:

-   BLTs currently use [scaling laws designed for BPE-based transformers](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.06754v1), which may not be optimal for their architecture. Future research is needed to develop **BLT-specific scaling laws** that could further improve their efficiency and performance.
-   Existing deep learning libraries are **highly optimized for tokenizer-based models**, making it difficult to achieve the same level of efficiency with BLTs.
-   BLTs require specialized implementations (such as [FlexAttention](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/)) but may still not match **BPE-based models in terms of wall-clock time**.
-   While early experiments suggest that **“byte-ifying” tokenizer-based models (e.g., Llama 3) is possible**, the process is not yet fully optimized.
-   More research is needed to ensure that **BLTs can match or surpass tokenizer-based models without requiring full retraining**.

[FAQs on Byte Latent Transformers (BLTs)](#faqs-on-byte-latent-transformers-blts)[](#faqs-on-byte-latent-transformers-blts)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [1\. How does BLT differ from traditional transformers?](#1-how-does-blt-differ-from-traditional-transformers)[](#1-how-does-blt-differ-from-traditional-transformers)

Traditional transformers use tokenization, where text is split into smaller units (words or subwords) before processing. BLTs, on the other hand, operate directly on byte sequences, grouping them into patches. This eliminates the need for tokenization and allows BLTs to work efficiently with any language or dataset without relying on predefined vocabularies.

### [2\. What are the benefits of BLT over tokenization?](#2-what-are-the-benefits-of-blt-over-tokenization)[](#2-what-are-the-benefits-of-blt-over-tokenization)

-   **Greater Flexibility:** Works with any language or text format without a tokenizer.
-   **Improved Efficiency:** Larger byte patches reduce computational overhead and improve scaling.
-   **Better Performance at Scale:** BLTs match or outperform token-based models as they grow in size.
-   **Reduced Preprocessing:** No need to train and fine-tune separate tokenizers for different languages.

### [3\. Is BLT suitable for multilingual data?](#3-is-blt-suitable-for-multilingual-data)[](#3-is-blt-suitable-for-multilingual-data)

Yes! Since BLTs work with raw bytes rather than language-specific tokens, they can naturally handle multiple languages, including those with complex scripts. This makes them particularly effective for multilingual AI models, eliminating the need for separate tokenization rules for each language.

### [4\. Can BLT be integrated with existing AI models?](#4-can-blt-be-integrated-with-existing-ai-models)[](#4-can-blt-be-integrated-with-existing-ai-models)

Yes, BLTs can be integrated with existing AI architectures, and early experiments show promising results in “byte-ifying” tokenizer-based models like Llama 3. While some optimizations are still needed, future developments may allow for seamless adaptation of BLTs in current AI workflows without retraining from scratch.

[Conclusions](#conclusions)[](#conclusions)
-------------------------------------------

The **Byte Latent Transformer (BLT)** represents a significant shift in how models can process raw data at the byte level. By moving away from fixed tokens and using dynamic patches based on entropy measures, BLT offers a more flexible and efficient approach to handling diverse data and computational needs. This method allows for a more granular understanding of the data, better computational efficiency, and improved flexibility in handling various input formats.

BLTs have significant potential but also require **further optimization, larger-scale testing, and software improvements** to reach their full efficiency. Future work on **scaling laws, model patching, and integration with existing deep learning frameworks** could help overcome these challenges.

While BLTs are still evolving, early results suggest they can match or even outperform traditional transformer models at scale. As AI continues to push the boundaries of efficiency and adaptability, BLTs could play a crucial role in shaping the future of natural language processing.
