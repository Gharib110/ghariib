# Malware Threat Intelligence and Blue Team talks at cons -- with Michael Gough Pt2

<br/>

<br/>
We're back with part 2 of our discussion with Michael Gough.  Not only do we discuss more about malware, but we also ask Michael's opinion on how commercialized conventions like Black Hat and Defcon have gotten, how good threat intelligence feeds are, and why there aren't more defensive talks at cons.

Michael is currently slated to give a talk on logging at DerbyCon September 24th, 2014 on how logging can help to mitigate malware infections.
