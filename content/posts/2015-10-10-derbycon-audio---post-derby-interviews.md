# Derbycon Audio - post-Derby interviews

<br/>

<br/>
In our last bit of Derbycon audio, I discussed DerbyCon experiences with Mr. Boettcher, Magen Wu (@tottenkoph), Haydn Johnson (@haydnjohnson), and Ganesh Ramakrishnan (@hyperrphysics). Â We find out what they liked, what they didn't like, and you get a lot of great information about packing for a con, things you can do to improve your convention going experience.

Hopefully, you'll hear the amount of fun we had, and find the time to go to a convention. There are literally hundreds, many only few hours by plane away. Some can be found in your own town or within driving distance.
