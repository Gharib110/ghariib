# Cyberattack chaos and the impact on families

<br/>

<br/>
This week we are joined by N2K CyberWire's very own Catherine Murphy, and she is sharing her family's experiences with Lurie Children's Hospital's recent cybersecurity incident. Dave shares a story on the dangers of Googling airline customer service numbers when an issue occurs. Joe shares another story on scary scams that are costing people millions of dollars, now getting the FBI involved. Our catch of the day was found from the Washington University in St. Louis from their Scam of the Month posting, which shares another tale of a scam, this time trying to recruit for an open vacancy as a research assistant for undergraduates. The scammers pose as a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering to try and get students to sign up for this fake job posting. Please take a moment to fill out an audience survey! Let us know how we are doing! Links to the stories: I’m begging you not to Google for airline customer service numbers Elaborate scam involves gold bars and couriers; cost a Maryland woman $2 million Scammers Use Couriers to Retrieve Cash and Precious Metals from Victims of Tech Support and Government Impersonation Scams Scam of the Month: RESEARCH ASSISTANT VACANCY FOR UNDERGRADUATE Ransomware gang claims to have made $3.4 million after attacking children’s hospital Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
