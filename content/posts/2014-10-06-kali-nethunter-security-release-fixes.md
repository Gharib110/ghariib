### Squash the Bugs with Kali 1.0.9a

Over the past couple of weeks, we’ve seen a bunch of nasty bugs hit the scene, from **shellshock** to Debian **[apt](https://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-3025)** vulnerabilities. As we prefer not to ship vulnerable ISOs, we’ve rolled up new images for our Kali Linux and NetHunter releases as well our Amazon AWS images with the relevant security fixes in place. These images correspond to Kali 1.0.9a and [NetHunter 1.0.2](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/kali-nexus-nethunter-1-0-2/) versions, now available for [download](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) through our mirrors. We expect the Amazon images to be updated in the AWS backend by the end of the week. If you’re already running Kali Linux, all you need to do is run an update and dist-upgrade to get the latest and greatest:

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### NetHunter for Professional Penetration Testing

The [OffSec NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/kali-nethunter/) release was a success and has brought about a huge amount of interest in our Nexus ROM overlay. We are happy and thankful to see a NetHunter community spring up and [contribute](https://www.kali.org/docs/community/contribute/) to the project so actively. Since the release, we have been repeatedly asked about our [Kali EULA](https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/eula/EULA.txt) and whether NetHunter can be used for **commercial purposes** such as professional penetration testing or running security assessments. **The answer is a resounding YES**, currently making NetHunter the only free Nexus Android system which is Open-source and allowed for commercial use. If you’re doing any serious work with NetHunter, make sure it is [properly secured](https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?23022-Securing-your-NetHunter-Device) and [encrypted](https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?22901-NetHunter-Disk-Encryption).

### Kali Linux Tools Listings

A month ago, we released the Kali Linux Tools website, detailing the tools available in Kali as well as simple usage examples. If you are the author of a tool that we have missed or have additional examples that you would like us to include in order to more fully cover your project, please feel free to [contact us](https://www.kali.org/contact/) to have your entries fixed.
