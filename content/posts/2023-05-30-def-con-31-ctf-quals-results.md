Just in time to wreck your productivity for the short week, hereâ€™s some delicious postgame info about the DEF CON 31 CTF Quals that happened over the weekend. Please enjoy the [official data dump from our good friends at The Nautilus Institute](https://quals.2023.nautilus.institute/). Additionally, please enjoy this set of informative [blog writeups from @Toasterpwn](https://toasterpwn.github.io/posts/defcon-ctf-2023-qualifiers/).  
  
Congratulations and godspeed to the victors. Respect to all who rose to the challenge. You are now free to get amped about the DEF CON 31 CTF in August. We will see you there.
