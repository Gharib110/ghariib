	<div>
		<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I’m excited to share my new open-source project, <strong>EasyREST</strong>. If you’ve ever worked with PostgREST for simple CRUD operations and thought, “I wish I could easily switch between SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and more,” then this project is for you!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-easyrest">What Is EasyREST?</h2>
<p>EasyREST is a lightweight and secure REST API server that gives you one unified interface for virtually any relational database. Instead of writing separate API layers for each database, EasyREST lets you connect to multiple databases through a single API with built-in support for authentication and context-aware queries.</p>

		<p>The field of generative AI (gen AI) is evolving rapidly, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) is at the forefront of this transformation. RHEL AI 1.4 introduces support for a new, powerful Granite 3.1 model with multi-language support and a larger context window. The latest version also adds capabilities for evaluating customized and trained models with Document-Knowledge bench (DK-bench), a benchmark designed to measure the knowledge a model has acquired. Finally, we’re introducing the developer preview of our new graphical UI that helps to simplify data ingestion and writing InstructL</p>

		<p>At Amazon Web Services (AWS), earning trust isn’t just a goal—it’s one of our core Leadership Principles that guide every decision we make. As CISO of AWS, I’ve seen firsthand how this commitment to earning trust shapes our culture, our services, and our daily interactions with customers. Customers choose AWS over other providers because they trust us to provide the most secure infrastructure and services, and to tell them exactly how data is being protected.</p>

<p>Check Point researchers have uncovered a sophisticated credential harvesting attack that leverages Firebase, a popular web application hosting service. This attack involves the creation of highly convincing and professionally designed phishing web pages that impersonate well-known services. The attackers also utilize a compromised vendor to send phishing links within existing email correspondences, making the scam even more deceptive. How it Works: The attackers leverage Firebase to host phishing web pages that mimic legitimate services. By compromising a vendor’s email account, cyber criminals then insert phishing links into ongoing email threads. This tactic increases the likelihood of the recipient trusting the […]</p>

<p>Software development is filled with repetitive tasks—managing issues, handling approvals, triggering CI/CD workflows, and more. But what if you could automate these types of tasks directly within GitHub Issues? That’s the promise of <strong>IssueOps</strong>, a methodology that turns GitHub Issues into a command center for automation.</p>
