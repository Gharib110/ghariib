# Help users in Iran reconnect to Signal

<br/>

<br/>
Just over a week ago, [we announced](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1353839763388649473) that Iranian censors had started blocking all Signal traffic in the country. As an interim solution to help people in Iran get connected again, weâ€™ve added support in Signal for a [simple TLS proxy](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-TLS-Proxy) that is easy to set up, can be used to bypass the network block, and will securely route traffic to the Signal service.

This new connection method is supported in the latest Signal Android beta release, and will be rolling out to production users in a few days. Our hope is that this will help many people in Iran start sending and receiving messages again while we continue to explore additional censorship circumvention techniques that will work there.
