# Thanks for a Great Con

DEF CON 31 is in the books, and the vibes were immaculate. We want to thank the DEF CON community for bringing all that good energy with you and making this such a memorable con. Good energy and stickers, and badges, and puzzles and hugs and for some reason Mal√∂rt. You really are an amazing group of humans.  
  
Special thanks to all the Goons who calmly and professionally evacuated the Forum and then got the whole con back on its feet. On time, no less. Borderline miraculous.  
  
If you want to keep that DEF CON feeling going throughout the off season, make sure to look into DEF CON Groups in your area. Can‚Äôt find one? Consider starting one.  
  
We‚Äôre already thinking about the next one, and we hope you‚Äôll all be there with us in this weird little summer house we‚Äôve built together. Stay safe and look out for each other. See you soon.
