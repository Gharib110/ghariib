# 2015-040 Defending against HTML 5 vulnerabilities

<br/>

<br/>
Last week, we discussed with Shreeraj Shah about HTML5, how it came into being and the fact that instead of solving OWASP issues, it introduces new and wonderful vulnerabilities, like exploiting locally stored web site info using XSS techniques, and doing SQLI on the new browser WebSQL.

So this week, it's all about defensive techniques that you can use to educate your developers against making mistakes that could get your company's web application on the front page of the news paper.
