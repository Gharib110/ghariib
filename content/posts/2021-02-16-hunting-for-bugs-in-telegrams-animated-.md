At the end of October â€˜19 I was skimming the [Telegramâ€™s android app code](https://github.com/drklo/telegram), learning about the technologies in use and looking for potentially interesting features. Just a few months earlier, Telegram had introduced the [animated stickers](https://telegram.org/blog/animated-stickers); after reading the blogpost I wondered how they worked _under-the-hood_ and if they created a new image format for it, then forgot about it. Back to the skimming, I stumbled upon the [**rlottie** folder](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/tree/master/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie) and started googling. It turned out to be the [Samsung native library](https://github.com/samsung/rlottie) for playing Lottie animations, originally created by [Airbnb](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/). I donâ€™t know about you but the combination of **Telegram**, **Samsung**, **native** and **animations** instantly triggered my interest in learning more ðŸ‘€.
