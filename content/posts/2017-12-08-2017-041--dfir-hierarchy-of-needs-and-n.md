# 2017-041- DFIR Hierarchy of Needs and new malware attacks

<br/>

<br/>
Maslow's Hierarchy of needs was developed with the idea that the most basic needs should be satisfied to allow for continued successful development of the person and the community inevitably created by people seeking the same goals.

DFIR is also much the same way in that there are certain necessary basics needed to ensure that you can detect, respond, and reduce possible damage inflicted by an attack.

In my searching, we saw a tweet about a #github from Matt Swann ([@MSwannMSFT](https://twitter.com/MSwannMSFT)) with just such a ' #DFIR hierarchy of needs'. We discuss everything that is needed to build out a proper DFIR program.

Mr. Boettcher discusses with us the latest #malware trends, using existing compromised emails to spread using threaded emails.

Based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's\_hierarchy\_of\_needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)

Requirements must be met before you can move on.

It’s not perfect, but gives a general idea of how needs should be met.
