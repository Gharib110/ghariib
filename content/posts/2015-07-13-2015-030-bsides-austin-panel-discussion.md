# 2015-030 Bsides Austin panel Discussion Red Team vs Blue Team

<br/>

<br/>
My podcast co-host Brian Boettcher, along with Kate Brew, an Austin, TX based security blogger, headed up this panel called "Red Team Vs. Blue Team". The idea was to ask people from various sides of the aisles (attackers and defenders) pressing questions about how the industry operates.

Infosec heavyweights like Kevin Johnson (@secureideas), Mano Paul (@manopaul), Josh Sokol (@joshSokol), made this a very excellent podcast...

We hope you enjoy!
