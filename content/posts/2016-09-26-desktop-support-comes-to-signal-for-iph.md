The latest Signal for iPhone release now includes multi-device support, allowing you to seamlessly move your private messaging experience from your iPhone to your desktop computer and back. Once youâ€™ve linked a desktop client from within the Signal iPhone app, you can switch to the desktop at any time, whether your phone is online or not.

The Signal Desktop app also supports a new iOS theme, which is enabled by default whenever you link a desktop client from the Signal iPhone app. Try it out!
