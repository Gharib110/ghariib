# Kali Tools Website Launched 109 Release
https://www.kali.org/blog/kali-linux-1-0-9-release/images/kali-1.0.9-release.jpg
<br/>

<br/>
Now that we have caught our breath after the Black Hat and DEF CON conferences, we have put aside some time to fix an annoying bug in our 1.0.8 ISO releases related to outdated firmware as well as regenerate fresh new ARM and VMware images (courtesy of [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/) ) for our new [1.0.9 release](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-vm). With this release come a few more updates worth mentioning:

##### Rasberry Pi B+ ARM Image Support

We are pleased to announce that we have updated our Raspberry Pi Kali image to support the new B+ model so that now it works out of the box. This single image now supports all Raspberry Pi models.

##### Odroid U3, Cubox-i ARM Images Added

We have also included two more images to our Kali ARM image collection for the Odroid U3 and Cubox-i ARM computers. Each of these have interesting use cases as both their small form factor and specs are formidable. All of these news scripts can be found in our [OffSec GitHub](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm) page.

##### New Kali Tools Website!

After many months of typing, editing, and testing, we are delighted to announce the launch of our new [Kali Linux Tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/) website. This new site is our official home for information on all of the tools included in Kali Linux. For each tool, you will find a description of the tool, links to the tool homepage, author and license information, and usage output so you can see what output you can expect from each utility in Kali.

In addition to the primary listing of all [Kali tools](https://www.kali.org/tools/), we have also made an effort to use tags throughout the site so you can more easily find a particular tool based on what it can do. You will find a tag cloud at the bottom of each page as you navigate the site. Also available is a full breakdown of the contents of each [Kali Linux metapackage](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/), allowing you to see which tool is included in a particular metapackage, which makes the building of [custom ISOs](https://www.kali.org/docs/development/live-build-a-custom-kali-iso/) much easier.

We hope you enjoy our new Kali Linux Tools site and find it as useful as we do. If you are a tool author and have additional examples that you would like us to include in order to more fully cover your project, please feel free to [contact us](https://www.kali.org/contact/).

##### Looking towards the future

We have a massive set of of surprises in the works, some of which will be revealed in [Brucon](http://2014.brucon.org/index.php/Training_Kali_Linux_Dojo) and [Derbycon](https://www.derbycon.com/2014/08/11/kali-linux-dojo-at-derbycon/), where weâ€™ll be running our second [Kali Linux Dojo](https://www.kali.org/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/). See you there!
