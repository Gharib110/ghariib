# Leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs

<br/>

<br/>
This week we are joined by Harry Maugans from Privacy Bee who sits down to discuss how our digital breadcrumbs, old and new, are coming back to haunt us. Joe and Dave discuss some follow up from listener Phil, who writes in with a question about the safety of IoT and consumer devices. Dave's story follows the ever so popular YouTube, and its implemented measures to prevent users with ad blockers from watching videos. Joe shares a personal story from a friend regarding a scam he had fallen for, where the scammer got personal information and threatened him, asking for $500. Our catch of the day comes from listener John who found a hilarious text conversation on reddit that he just had to share. Links to the stories: YouTube's ‘War’ on Adblockers Shows How Google Controls the Internet Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share? Email it to us at hackinghumans@thecyberwire.com.
