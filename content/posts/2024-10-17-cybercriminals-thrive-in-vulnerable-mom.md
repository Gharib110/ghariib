# Cybercriminals thrive in vulnerable moments

<br/>

<br/>
Maria Varmazis, host of N2K's daily space show T-Minus, joins Dave and Joe to share the story of how cybercriminals are exploiting the chaos following Hurricane Helene in Florida by launching scams and phishing attacks. Veritiâ€™s research highlights three key threats: FEMA claim scams, phishing using hurricane-related domains, and malicious files disguised as FEMA documents, all targeting vulnerable individuals. This week, Joe's got three hard-hitting stories lined up! First, U.S. authorities have charged 18 individuals and companies for pulling off fraudulent schemes to manipulate cryptocurrency markets. Next, leaders from four crypto firms and market makers face charges for wash-trading and inflating prices to lure in investors. Finally, in a groundbreaking move, federal prosecutors have launched the first-ever criminal case targeting wash trading in digital assets, shaking up the crypto world. Dave share's a Facebook watch you can't say no too. Our catch of the day comes from Reddit, and follows a chain of messages where a scammer is sharing news that sounds a bit too good to be true. Links to the stories: Exploiting Hurricane Helene with FEMA Scams and Phishing Threats Eighteen Individuals and Entities Charged in International Operation Targeting Widespread Fraud and Manipulation in the Cryptocurrency Markets Seeking Information in Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud Investigation U.S. Federal Prosecutors File First-Ever Criminal Charges for Crypto Market Manipulation You can hear more from the T-Minus space daily show here.
