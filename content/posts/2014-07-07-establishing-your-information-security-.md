# Establishing your Information Security Program - Part 2

<br/>

<br/>
This is the continuation of our podcast from last week with Phil Beyer.

We started out talking about risk registers, and we end the podcast with a little Q&A about positions in companies (Chief Risk Officer, Chief Data Protection Officer), and whether these positions are useful.
