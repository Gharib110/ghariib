“There are those who will point to [the FAQ](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq) for the SSPL and claim that the license isn’t interpreted in that way because the FAQ says so. Unfortunately, when you agree to a license you are agreeing to the _text of that license document_ and not to a FAQ. If the text of that license document is ambiguous, then so are your rights and responsibilities under that license. Should your compliance to that license come before a judge, it’s _their_ interpretation of those rights and responsibilities that will hold sway. This ambiguity puts your organisation at risk.”

@vmbrasseur:  [(1) VM (Vicky) Brasseur on Twitter: "With today's relicensing to #SSPL, Elasticsearch & Kibana are no longer #OpenSource but are instead business risks: https://t.co/XNx2EMLNfH" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmbrasseur/status/1349809006836023296)

[(1) Adam Jacob on Twitter: "Yeah, come on - how can this be "doubling down on open"? Some true duplicity here. https://t.co/rlJVnLxYwP - we're taking two widely used, widely distributed, widely incorporated open source projects and making them no longer open source. But we're doubling down on open!" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1349764557695139840)

[\[License-review\] Approval: Server Side Public License, Version 2 (SSPL v2) (opensource.org)](http://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review_lists.opensource.org/2019-March/003989.html)

“We continue to believe that the SSPL complies with the Open Source

Definition and the four essential software freedoms.  However, based on its

reception by the members of this list and the greater open source

community, the community consensus required to support OSI approval does

not currently appear to exist regarding the copyleft provision of SSPL.

Thus, in order to be respectful of the time and efforts of the OSI board

and this list’s members, we are hereby withdrawing the SSPL from OSI

consideration.”

(could be ‘open-source’, but negative feedback on mailing lists and elsewhere made the remove it from consideration from OSI)

Open Source license requirements: [The Open Source Definition | Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd)

What does this mean? 

If you have products that utilize ElasticSearch/MongoDB/Kibana in some way, talk to your legal teams to find out if you need to divest your org from them. These are not ‘opensource’ licenses… they are ‘source available’

It might not affect your organization and moving to SSPL might be feasible. If your product makes any changes internally to ElasticSearch,
