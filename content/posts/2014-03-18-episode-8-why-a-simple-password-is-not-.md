# Episode 8 Why a simple password is not so simple

<br/>

<br/>
Cracking great show this week!  Mr. Boettcher and I got all into authentications methods, why they don't always work, and what can we do to make passwords more secure, using Mike Murray's method of 'Passphrases' over passwords...

Finally, we talked about some adventure Mr. boettcher had with a friend's malware infection (it wasn't me, I promise!).  He took what we learned from @hackerhurricane (Michael Gough) and is actively doing forensics on it.
