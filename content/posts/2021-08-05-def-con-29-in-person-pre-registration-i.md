The DEF CON 29 pre-reg at shop.defcon.org is now closed. You can still get a badge with cash payment onsite while they last, and you can purchase the Human+ Discord role directly on our Discord ([discord.gg/defcon](https://discord.gg/defcon)) or at [plus.defcon.org](https://plus.defcon.org) Thanks to everyone for supporting DEF CON this year, whether you’re attending virtually or here with us in Las Vegas. DEF CON ❤️ U. Tomorrow it begins!
