This January, Open Whisper Systems will be hosting a _Winter Break Of Code_. We’ve managed to get access to a large beachfront house in Kauai for three weeks, and we’re inviting people to join us. If you’re interested in spending one to three weeks in Hawaii working collaboratively on an Open Source project to make private communication simple, we’ll take care of your airfare and housing so that you can be there.

_Winter Break Of Code_ is an opportunity for designers, developers, writers, strategists, and creative thinkers interested in privacy and security to spend some time contributing to privacy-related projects in a retreat-like setting with other co-conspirators. Think of it as an extended hackathon, but with your travel expenses paid, and with breaks for surfing, hiking, swimming, and just generally being in Kauai.

Everything that Open Whisper Systems produces is free and Open Source. We’ve been working on apps like [Signal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669), [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms), [RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone), and [Flock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anhonesteffort.flock) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed apps that are both privacy-preserving _and_ a joy to use.
