# Predictible seed in Anthos Identity Service LDAP module

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability was discovered in the Anthos Identity Service (AIS) LDAP module of Anthos clusters on VMware versions 1.8 and 1.8.1 where a seed key used in generating keys is predictable. With this vulnerability, an authenticated user could add arbitrary claims and escalate privileges indefinitely.
