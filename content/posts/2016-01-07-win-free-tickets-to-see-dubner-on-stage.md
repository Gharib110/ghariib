# Win Free Tickets to See Dubner on Stage in Brooklyn on January 14

<br/>

<br/>
When **Stephen Dubner**’s new podcast _Question of the Day_ [launched in August](http://freakonomics.com/2015/11/02/introducing-question-of-the-day-a-new-dubner-podcast/), it immediately shot to No. 1 on the iTunes chart. Last month it was selected as one of iTunes "Best of 2015." (You can [subscribe here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/question-of-the-day/id1034048768?mt=2).) Now you can come see a live taping of the show on Thursday, January 14, at [The Bell House](http://www.thebellhouseny.com/event/1009189-question-day-live-stephen-brooklyn/) in Brooklyn. Join Dubner, his _Question of the Day_ co-host, **[James Altucher](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/)**, and their special guest **[Negin Farsad](http://neginfarsad.com/)** for an evening of conversation that will run from the ridiculous to the sublime (and occasionally both).
