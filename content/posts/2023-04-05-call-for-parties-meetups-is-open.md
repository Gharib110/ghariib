DEF CON has hosted some legendary parties, and we’re always looking for the next one. If you’re sitting on a DEF CON party concept that could take things to the next level, you should share it with us. If your idea gets selected, we’ll work with you to make it happen. [The info you need is here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfopp.html). It’s the shortest distance between partygoer and party legend. Don’t miss your shot.
