# DeepSec 2024 Talk Executive Breach Simulation Toolkits Pavle Bozalo Aron Feuer Matias Ulloa

<br/>

<br/>
As cyberattacks multiply and become more sophisticated, executive breach simulation toolkits have become essential. Enabling organizations to simulate, predict, and assess the impact of potential security breaches from an executive perspective is necessary to know how to keep organizations safe. Unfortunately, simulations are broken. Simply put, they don’t properly prepare leaders and security practitioners for security breaches. This talk will look at the evolving landscape of breach simulation toolkits designed for security practitioners, focusing on their role in enhancing cybersecurity strategies, incident preparedness, and organizational resilience. We will see how simulations can be engaging, while remaining instructive and preparing people for actual cyber events. We’ll discuss how these toolkits work, why they’re essential for making smarter business decisions around cybersecurity, and how they help align leadership with technical teams. Real-world examples will show how
