# io

<br/>

<br/>
Wow, it's been a awhile since i haven't written anything new here...  
So to answer many questions.. no i'm not dead, and will try to get active again a bit next year.  
  
I'm not writing this due to explanation requests or people worried (even if i got solicited many time to write something) but more because i'm motivated again to write.  
As i've said many times to the recurrent e-mails i receive and continue to receive (even after 7 months of inactivity!)  
I've did a lot of changement in my life, and during this time i got better things to do than writing in a blog.  
Principaly i had many personal issues to resolve.  
It's also not the first time i repeat that i've a life and that i've always run this blog for fun and nonprofit like my other services such as [cybercrime-tracker.net](http://cybercrime-tracker.net/)  
And sooner or later i will get bored and do a break although i've continued to update CCT, to don't leave people with nothing.

I changed of job also and shifted in the energy sector.  
I wanted to get a job who combine my passion for mechanic and electronic.  
And now i'm winding turbo-alternators for nuclear/hydraulic power plants around the world and governmental organisations. (pretty cool, huh?)  
I can't tell you details obviously due to confidentiality clauses as it's critical, but making those huge machines/projects are quite awesome and the job is very meticulous.  
  
I've joined also the administration of my local [hackerspace](http://hackaday.io/hackerspace/1374-hackgyver), and now holds the position of treasurer.  
I'm doing also various workshops mostly electronic/borderline related who take me time to prepare and organize.  
In parallel i experiment myself also a lot, those who follow my youtube/twitter activity probably know what i mean, i received 2 day ago hydrofluoric acid.  
  
2014 started a bit bad for me as i had a car crash the day of christmas and got the clavicle broken. Anyway globally it was a nice year, and off my blog i've met a lot of people like Horgh and many others.  
Sadly i wasn't able to go to BotConf neither DahuCon this year due to my job... so maybe next year !  
  
I've worked a bit also with [Hackerstrip](http://hackerstrip.com/) and released recently some codes for [DarK-CodeZ #6](http://vxheaven.org/vx.php?id=zd12&lang=en&fid=2017#f2017), nothing fancy but it was fun to participate, thanks guys.  
So that all, see you in 2015 for throwing cobblestones and breaking bones !
