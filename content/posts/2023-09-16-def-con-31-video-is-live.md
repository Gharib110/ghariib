It's that time of the year again - time to block off a weekend or two and watch [videos from DEF CON 31 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Om9kAkl32dWlDSNlDS9Iw)!  
  
We've got all the main stage talks, a bunch of Village Stage talks, War Stories and the Policy series, all waiting to entertain and enlighten you. If this is somehow not enough, There's even more to choose from on [media.defcon.org](https://media.defcon.org).  
  
Please bingewatch responsibly, and pass it on.
