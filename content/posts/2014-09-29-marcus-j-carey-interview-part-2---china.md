# Marcus J Carey Interview Part 2 - China IP coming cyber war

<br/>

<br/>
We finished up our odyssey with Marcus J. Carey this week.  We picked his brain about how he feel about China, the coming cyberwar, and what kinds of tools he uses in his toolbox (hint: he doesn't use Kali).

We also talk a bit about the entitlement of people, and what makes folks in poorer countries turn to hacking. We really enjoyed hearing his take on certifications and education. He's a Ruby nut, but suggests that people learn Python. He also talks about how he teaches people about security. The little everyday things that show you do security.

A thought provoking interview that will definitely inspire you to pour yourself into a Python book, or to grab a Raspberry Pi and start learning.
