Good Tech Inc. has realised its machines were vulnerable. They have decided to deploy a permanent VAPT machine within their network, where contractors can remotely access to perform the necessary vulnerability assessment scans.

However, this has not been the most secure deployment. Can you root this machine?

If you MUST have hints for this machine: ELECTRICAL is (#1): well-intentioned but horrible in execution, (#2): has multiple paths to privilege escalation, (#3): how you should not configure vendor configurations for VAPT work.
