The past few years have been crazy, but you can’t stop the signal, even with global cataclysm. We are so happy to be reunited with so many of our friends, both here in Las Vegas and in the virtual con space. It’s good to be together.  
  
Thank you for your support through everything. Your unending enthusiasm sustains our work and the DEF CON community never disappoints. Thanks for following the stricter rules the pandemic made necessary. Thanks for being kind and patient with each other and with us as we navigate the swiftly changing landscape.  
  
Next year is a big anniversary for DEF CON, and we’re already at work planning how to make the big 3-0 memorable. Here’s to next year reuniting even more of us.  
  
In the meantime, keep in touch with us on the DEF CON Discord server. Join a local DC Group, or start one. Stay safe and healthy. DEF CON hearts you.
