Kali NetHunter has been undergoing a ton of changes of late. Now supporting over 50 devices and running on Android devices from KitKat (v4.4) to Pie (v9.0), its amazing the extra capabilities that have been introduced.

But, we don’t want to stop there. After a ton of work, we are really excited to introduce the [Kali NetHunter App Store](https://store.nethunter.com/)!

The New Android Store Dedicated to Free Security Apps
-----------------------------------------------------

Originally meant to conveniently manage the packages on NetHunter devices, we soon realized that the NetHunter store should also be available for non-NetHunter devices. So here it is, available to everyone that would like the best of both worlds:

-   Ease of use and convenience of the Google Play Store
-   Freedom, anonymity and privacy of sideloaded applications

The Kali NetHunter App Store is a one stop shop for security relevant Android applications. It is the ultimate alternative to the Google Play store for any Android device, whether rooted or not, NetHunter or stock. If you are after any security application for your Android device, the NetHunter Store will be the place to get it.

The NetHunter store is powered by a slightly modified version of [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/), thanks to the hard work of the F-Droid community, in particular [Peter Serwylo](https://twitter.com/serwylo) whose help was invaluable. Whilst F-Droid installs its clients with telemetry disabled and asks for consent before submitting crash reports, we went a step further and removed the entire code - just to make sure that our privacy cannot be compromised by accident.

We also widened the inclusion policy to allow proprietary applications into the store.

### Call for Applications

If you are an application developer and you would like your application to be included in the NetHunter App Store, please let us know via a [Request for packaging](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/store/rfp/-/issues) or in the [forums](https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store).

Please note: We accept binary APK files as well as links to git repositories that we use to build the applications ourselves. Third party APK files are preferably signed by the original author whereas apps built by us from source are built using GitLab CI and are signed by us.

If you would like us to include an application that you are not the author of, please let us know and we’ll try to get the authors consent to publish it in our store.

More information about contributing applications can be found [here](https://store.nethunter.com/en/contribute/)

### Call for Contributors

NetHunter is a community project. It is driven by the community for the community and it is a whole lot of fun. The project is centered around bringing Kali Linux to Android devices and to add a user experience that makes Android a valid alternative for certain areas of penetration testing and hacking.

Working on the NetHunter project, including the NetHunter Store, provides exposure to a wide variety of technologies, such as:

-   Android app development
-   Rooting Android & creating custom recovery installers
-   Kernel & kernel drivers, in particular WiFi
-   Kali Linux
-   All tools that ship with Kali Linux
-   Web technologies
-   Android package management
-   …and many more.

But most importantly:

-   Putting it all together and hack Radio frequency (RF), Wi-Fi, Apps and everything else you can get your hands on!

If you are good at any of the above, or you would like to become good at any of them, please join us in the [forums](https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?35-App-Store) or on [IRC](https://www.kali.org/docs/community/kali-linux-irc-channel/) OFTC, #NetHunter\]([https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&channels=nethunter)](https://webchat.oftc.net/?randomnick=1&channels=nethunter\)).
