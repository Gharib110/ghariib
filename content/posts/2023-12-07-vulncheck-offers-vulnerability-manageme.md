# VulnCheck Offers Vulnerability Management Continuity by Maintaining NIST NVD 10 After Migration Deadline

<br/>

<br/>
\*\*LEXINGTON, MA\*\* -- December 7, 2023-- VulnCheck, the exploit intelligence company, today announced that it will provide and maintain the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API 1.0 ahead of the December 15 migration deadline. As part of the company’s first Community Platform tier offering, the database is freely available to all users and enables security teams to maintain vulnerability management continuity until they migrate to the 2.0 APIs. \\n \\nThreat detection and response, vulnerability management, and other cybersecurity teams leverage NIST's NVD 1.0 APIs to pull data into scan engines to prioritize patching and remediation of vulnerabilities. Announced in 2022, the NVD plans to retire its legacy data feeds and 1.0 APIs on December 15, 2023. VulnCheck's maintenance of NVD 1.0 allows security teams to set their own migration timeline. \\n\\n::author-quote\\n---\\nauthor: Anthony Bettini \\nposition: Founder and CEO \\n---\\nAs the deadline approaches, organizations that rely heavily on NVD data and have not prepared for the transition will be left out in the cold. We’re happy to maintain this and offer it for free to anyone as part of our Community Platform tier.\\n::\\n\\nVulnCheck is hyper-focused on helping the cybersecurity community solve the vulnerability prioritization challenge through its exploit intelligence solutions. VulnCheck's maintenance of NVD 1.0 is a complimentary community offering. It will be maintained for as long as any organization needs access and is not ready to overhaul current workflows and API schemas. \\n\\n::author-quote\\n---\\nauthor: Anthony Bettini \\nposition: Founder and CEO \\n---\\nThe changes brought on by NVD's 2.0 APIs will force development teams to redesign how CVE data is acquired, processed, and loaded, which will take significant time and testing. Our goal is to ensure that all vulnerability management operations designed for NVD 1.0 will function as needed until teams are ready to make the jump.\\n::\\n\\nMore information, including the complete NVD 1.0 database, can be found on VulnCheck’s website: https://vulncheck.com/nvd\\n\\n### About VulnCheck\\nVulnCheck is the vulnerability intelligence company helping enterprises, government organizations, and cybersecurity vendors solve the vulnerability prioritization challenge.
