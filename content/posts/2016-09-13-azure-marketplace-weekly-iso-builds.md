Kali Linux in the Azure Marketplace
-----------------------------------

Over the past couple of weeks we’ve been working on building and implementing Kali 2016.2 in the **Azure Marketplace**. We’re happy to announce that from today on, you can [spin up a Kali machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/kali-linux/kali-linux/) from the Azure Marketplace. In just a few seconds, you can have a full **penetration testing toolset** at your fingertips for no additional cost (other than the standard Azure pricing). If you are a new Azure customer, you can create a free account and receive [$200 credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/). If you are performing penetration testing, please refer to the [Azure Testing Request](https://security-forms.azure.com/penetration-testing/terms) for more information.

Kali Linux Weekly ISO Builds
----------------------------

As we mentioned in our Kali Rolling 2016.2 release, we’ve started building weekly images of our Kali ISOs. This allows people access to “fresher” and more up-to-date Kali builds at any given time, and helps cut back on the long waits for updates. The ISOs will be generated each **Sunday** and will be versioned as “**\-W**”. Once all builds are generated, they will be available via [cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly](http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/). Each weekly release will have it’s own SHA1SUM file which will be available at [archive.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/SHA1SUMS](https://archive.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/SHA1SUMS).

Mr Robot, Ekoparty, and Release Aftermath
-----------------------------------------

We are overjoyed with the **positive feedback** we have received from the 2016.2 update and our download servers have been squealing, serving well over 290,000 copies of Kali this month. We very much appreciate the kind words and as always, would recommend that if you happen to come across any problems - make sure to report them to us through our [bug tracker](https://bugs.kali.org/).

Additionally, we have had the pleasure of watching Kali make an appearance on [Mr Robot](https://www.usanetwork.com/mr-robot) multiple times! We have always been impressed with how grounded the technology is on that show, and seeing Kali leveraged in realistic manners is always fun. Finally, we wanted to make one last shout out about the upcoming Kali Dojo at [ekoparty](https://ekoparty.org/kali-workshops.php). If you are attending, be sure to drop in and say hello!
