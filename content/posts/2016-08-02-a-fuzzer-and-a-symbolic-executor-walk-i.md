Finding bugs in programs is hard. Automating the process is even harder. We tackled the harder problem and produced two production-quality bug-finding systems: GRR, a high-throughput fuzzer, and PySymEmu (PSE), a binary symbolic executor with support for concrete inputs. From afar, fuzzing is a dumb, brute-force method that works surprisingly well, and symbolic execution is \[â€¦\]
