# A Sneak Peek into Smart Contracts Reversing and Emulation





In the last years the web3 topic became increasingly relevant and, as for every buzzword, a lot of companies and start-ups started developing solutions based on it. Consequently there also was an increase on the number of attacks and vulnerabilities found in such projects, for example: Saurik&rsquo;s write up on Optimism,

In the last years the web3 topic became increasingly relevant and, as for every buzzword, a lot of companies and start-ups started developing solutions based on it.  
Consequently there also was an increase on the number of attacks and vulnerabilities found in such projects, for example: [Saurikâ€™s write up on Optimism](https://www.saurik.com/optimism.html), the [PolyNetwork hack](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2021/08/12/the-poly-network-hack-explained/), the [Ronin Validator compromission](https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/community-alert-ronin-validators?s=w), and [many](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-history-of-the-dao-hack) [more](https://cointelegraph.com/news/accidentally-killed-it-parity-grapples-with-280-mln-locked-eth).

In this post we will scratch the surface of the topic, limiting our focus on the Ethereum blockchain. We will take a look at the EVM bytecode, and learn how to reverse and emulate a smart contract with [Qiling](https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling).
