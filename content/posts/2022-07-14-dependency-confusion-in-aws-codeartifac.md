# Dependency confusion in AWS CodeArtifact

<br/>

<br/>
AWS CodeArtifact was susceptible to dependency confusion / substitution (i.e, publication of a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as an organizationâ€™s internal package). AWS fixed this issue by adding package origin controls, allowing users to limit how versions of a given package can be added to a CodeArtifact repository.
