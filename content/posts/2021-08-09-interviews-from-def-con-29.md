We’d like to shout out newly minted Photogoon Alex Chaveriat aka ‘Silk’ who spent his DEF CON 29 racing around the con floor finding cool projects to interview people about. If you follow the DC social media feeds you’ve probably seen some of his work this year. Thanks to everyone who gave him some time, and thanks to Alex for putting out so much quality stuff so quickly. [Alex Chaveriat on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbHYwhbarpO6vXgbIYmcXnQ)
