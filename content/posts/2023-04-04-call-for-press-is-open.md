Attention all inky-fingered chroniclers of the hackersphere - press registration for DEF CON 31 is now officially open! If you’re interested in covering our little hacker party in the desert, you’ll need to get your application in before while there’s space. [Read the rules (for real, read the rules) here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-press.html) and get your bid in while supplies last. Operators are metaphorically standing by.
