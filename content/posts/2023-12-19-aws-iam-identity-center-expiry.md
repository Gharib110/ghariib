# AWS IAM Identity Center Expiry

<br/>

<br/>
AWS IAM Identity Center exchanges third-party OIDC tokens for Identity Center-issued tokens. Identity Center relies on the jti claim in the third-party tokens to prevent replay attacks. Identity Center maintained a cache of previously-seen jti values for a fixed period (24 hours) and didnâ€™t enforce that the third-party tokens had expiry claims. This meant that a token with a jti claim and without an exp claim could be replayed after >24 hours had passed.
