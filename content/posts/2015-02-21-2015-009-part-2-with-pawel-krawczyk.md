# 2015-009-Part 2 with Pawel Krawczyk

The second part of our interview with Pawel discussed Content management systems, and how you can integrate CSP in Drupal, Django, and the like.

Content managers, you'll want to listen to this, especially about how CSP can help you secure the content on your systems, as well as protect customers from web based attacks using the sandboxing functions of CSP
