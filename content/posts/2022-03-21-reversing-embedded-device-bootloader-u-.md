# Reversing embedded device bootloader U-Boot - p2

<br/>

<br/>
_This blog post is not intended to be a ‚Äú101‚Äù ARM firmware reverse-engineering tutorial or a guide to attacking a specific IoT device. The goal is to share our experience and, why not, perhaps save you some precious hours and headaches._

Sum up
------

The first post dealt with some more theoretical aspects at a very low level, instead this one will show how we finally decrypted the kernel image. DO NOT PANIC - we will not be as long-winded as in the first post. üòá
