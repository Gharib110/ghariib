# 2017-003-Amanda Berlin at ShmooCon

<br/>

<br/>
Amanda Berlin attended Shmoocon this year, and sat down with a few people. She discussed a bit with John about what HackEd is about (http://hackeducate.com/)  
  
Amands writes: "I had an amazing time at my 3rd #Shmoocon. I was able to interview a handful of really cool people working on several different types of infosec education. I was able to watch a few talks, spend some time in the lockpick village, as well as go to Shmoocon Epilogue. It’s always amazing to watch people talk about what they are passionate about, and Shmoocon is a great relaxed environment where that happens frequently."

Melanie Rich-Wittrig (@securitycandy) discusses how she's empowering kids to get into information security, even as early as age 10 or 11. She discusses how she motivates by teaching CTF and hacking concept, and gamifying by using point systems.
