# The SODA Machine is back

<br/>

Returning for DEF CON 31- the S.O.D.A. (Shell on Demand Appliance) Machine! S.O.D.A. is an unassuming vending machine that is fresh out of sodapop, but it grants creds to your very own anonymous VM running right there at DEF CON. Visit S.O.D.A. in the Chillout Lounge of Caesars Forum throughout Con.  
  
You can find out more and ask questions on the [S.O.D.A. Machine sub-forum](https://forum.defcon.org/node/246908), and you can also check out [this video from last year's appearance](https://youtu.be/bRTS-NTT7iQ) for more details!
