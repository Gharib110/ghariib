# 2017-SPECIAL005-End of year Podcast with podcasters

<br/>

<br/>
As is tradition (or becoming around here) we like to get a bunch of podcasters together and just talk about our year. No prognostications, a bit of silliness, and we still manage to get in some great infosec content.

Please enjoy! And please seek out these podcasts and have a listen!

Slight warning: **some rough language**

"We are gearing up for the Hack In The Box Amsterdam 2018, which is now on its 9th edition, and will take place between the 9th and 13th April at the same venue as last year, the Grand Krasnapolsky hotel in the center of Amsterdam: [https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018ams/](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018ams/) The list of trainings is already published and looking as awesome as ever: [https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018ams/training](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018ams/training) .  The CFP is open and the review board is already hard at work with the first submissions."

"If you have an interesting security talk and fancy visiting Amsterdam in the spring, then submit your talk to the Hack In The Box Amsterdam conference, which will take place between 9 and 13 April 2018. The Call For Papers is open until the end of December, submission details can be found at [https://cfp.hackinthebox.org/](https://cfp.hackinthebox.org/). Tickets are already on sale, with early bird prices until December 31st.
