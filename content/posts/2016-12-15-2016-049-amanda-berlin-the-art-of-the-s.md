# 2016-049-Amanda Berlin the art of the sale and Decision making trees

<br/>

<br/>
 "Always Be Closing" is the mantra that Alec Baldwin's character "Blake" intones in the movie "#GlenGarry #Glen #Ross". Ironically, the film about 4 men selling was a failure in the theaters.

A lot of times as #blue #teamers, we find ourselves in the sights of a #sales person, or often enough, we are inviting them into our conference rooms to find out how their widget will help save the day. There's an art to the concept of selling, honed over the past 500,000 years, since Ugg tried to convince Oog that his wheel would revolutionize work...

We asked Ms. Amanda Berlin (@infosystir) to join us this week, for her expertise at working at an security company, as well as someone who sells products, to discuss how and why sales and sales engineers do what they do. I posit that there must be 'decision tree' or script that most follow in an effort to make a sale, and how to confront the pushy sales pitch head on, or in Amanda's way, to avoid it altogether.

We discuss Amanda's book she co-wrote with Lee Brotherston, whom we've had on our show before. Their #O'Reilly #book is on pre-sale right now, so you can order "The #Defensive #Security #Handbook" here: [http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051671.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051671.do)
