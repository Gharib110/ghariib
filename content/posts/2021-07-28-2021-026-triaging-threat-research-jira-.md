“"After installing updates released July 13, 2021 on domain controllers (DCs) in your environment, printers, scanners, and multifunction devices that are not compliant with section 3.2.1 of [RFC 4556 spec](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4556.txt) might fail to print when using smart card (PIV) authentication," Microsoft [explained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-21h1#1663msgdesc).”

 “Shlayer, discovered in 2018, is constantly maintained and also evolving. The graph below is representative of Shlayer continually being a go-to piece of malware that attackers use to compromise the victim’s machine. We observed an uptick in Shlayer detections occurring before the release of CVE-2021-30657 (the Gatekeeper bypass) that was being exploited by Shlayer. This vulnerability was subsequently patched on April 26, 2021.”

“It works by enabling attackers to misuse the alloca() function in a way that would result in memory corruption. This, in turn, allows a hacker to crash systemd and hence the entire operating system. Practically speaking, this can be done by a local attacker mounting a filesystem on a very long path. This causes too much memory space to be used in the systemd stack, which results in a system crash.”   
There's no way to remedy this problem. While it's not present in all current Linux distros, you'll find it in most distros such as the [Debian 10 (Buster)](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/) and its relatives like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/). Therefore, you must, if you value keeping your computers working, patch your version of systemd as soon as possible. You'll be glad you did.
