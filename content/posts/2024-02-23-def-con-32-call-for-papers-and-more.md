DEF CON 32 preparations are well and truly underway. You can tell because the air is thick with call announcements.  
  
The Calls opening today are:  
[CFP](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-cfp.html)  
[Workshops](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-cfw.html)  
[Demo Labs](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-cfdl.html)  
[Policy](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-cfp-form.html)  
  
As always, don’t procrastinate. The chances of your idea getting over the finish line are better when the reviewer has time to communicate with you.  
  
The information about all the [open calls is here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-cfi.html). We can’t wait to see what you’re working on.
