The moment has arrived - the DEF CON 33 Call Season is officially afoot! Time to get thinking on how you want to participate. Whether you've got ideas to start a new Village, or have the tunes to rock the crowd after hours, the doors are open. There are a bunch of Calls you can peruse at leisure from Contests to Soundtrack to Vendors, and all the info you need to get started is on the [DEF CON 33 Call Index](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-cfi.html).

Don't let your dreams be dreams! Make this the year your idea makes headlines at DEF CON.

DEF CON season is underway, people. Let's get after it.
