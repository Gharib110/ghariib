# Is Silencing a Few Million Americans Protected Speech

<br/>

<br/>
The Supreme Court has granted certiorari to review two big state laws [trying to impose limits on social media](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/us/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YvQEgjuo$) censorship (or “curation,” if you prefer) of platform content. [Paul Stephan](https://www.law.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/pbs/1211911) and I spar over the right outcome, and the likely vote count, in the two cases. One surprise: we both think that the platforms’ claim of a first amendment right to curate content  is in tension with their claim that they, uniquely among speakers, should have an immunity for their “speech.”

Maury weighs in to note that the [EU is now gearing up to bring social media to heel](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/technology/disinformation-law-european-union.html?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YQWL_-NY$) on the “disinformation” front. That fight will be ugly for Big Tech, he points out, because Europe doesn’t mind if it puts social media out of business, since it’s an American industry. I point out that elites all across the globe have rallied to meet and defeat social media’s challenge to their agenda-setting and reality-defining authority. India is [aggressively](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/26/india-facebook-propaganda-hate-speech/__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YSoPElcI$) doing [the same](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/26/india-monu-manesar-viligante-social-media/). 

Paul covers another big story in law and technology. The [FTC has sued Amazon for antitrust violations](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/ftc-and-17-states-sue-amazon-on-antitrust-charges.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0Y6wfQnHw$)—essentially [price gouging](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.wsj.com/tech/ftc-sues-amazon-alleging-illegal-online-marketplace-monopoly-6bd9af23?mod=hp_lead_pos1&utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YiYCmOPg$) and tying. Whether the conduct alleged in the complaint is even a bad thing will depend on the facts, so the case will be hard fought. And, given the FTC’s track record, no one should be betting against Amazon.

[Nick Weaver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-weaver-13893644/) explains the dynamic behind the [massive MGM and Caesars hacks.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.wired.com/story/mgm-ceasars-hack-ransomware/?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YczZx5UU$) As with so many globalized industries, ransomware now has Americans in marketing (or social engineering, if you prefer) and foreign technology suppliers. Nick thinks it’s time to OFAC ‘em all.

Maury explains the latest bulk intercept decision from the [European Court of Human Rights](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng**A7B*22itemid*22:*5B*22001-226468*22*5D*7D__;IyUlJSUlJSUl!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YiQJjT0k$). The UK has lost again, but it’s not clear how much difference that will make. The ruling says that [non-Brits can sue the UK over bulk interception](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.computerweekly.com/news/366552081/GCHQ-breached-privacy-rights-of-IT-professional-and-security-researcher-human-rights-court-rules?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0Y9GGlqKU$), but the court has already made clear that, with a few legislative tweaks, bulk interception is legal under the European human rights convention.

More bad news for 230 maximalists: it turns out that [Facebook can be sued for allowing advertisers to target ads based on age and gender](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889747/facebook-biased-ad-algorithm-aclu-court__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YdxycOBc$). The platform slipped from allowing speech [to being liable for speech](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.aclu.org/cases/liapes-v-facebook-inc?document=Opinion&utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YxQN-5Rk$) because it facilitated advertiser’s allegedly discriminatory targeting. 

The UK competition authorities are seeking [greater access to AI’s inner workings to assess risks](https://medium.com/@ainewesttechhub/uk-pushes-for-greater-access-to-ais-inner-workings-to-assess-risks-36cd77ec53c5), but [Maury Shenk](https://www.steptoe.com/en/lawyers/maury-shenk.html) is sure this is part of a light touch on AI regulation that is meant to make the UK a safe European harbor for AI companies.

In a few quick hits and updates:

-   I explain the [splintered PCLOB report that endorses 702 renewal, with widely diverging proposals for reform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/09/28/surveillance-702-law-privacy/).
    
-   Paul tells us that the [Biden Administration plans to bring back “net neutrality” rules.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/net-neutrality-rules-broadband-internet-biden.html?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YwiRHeqs$) Hey, if we get to choose which golden oldie to revive, I actually liked the macarena more.
    
-   I flag an issue likely to spark a surprisingly bitter clash between the administration and cloud providers – Know Your Customer rules. The [government thinks it’s irresponsible](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/therecord.media/cloud-security-know-your-customer-white-house-industry-clash__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0YD3jGkow$) from a cybersecurity point of view to let randos spin up virtual machines. The [industry doesn’t think the market will tolerate any other way of doing business](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.documentcloud.org/documents/23993403-09192023-draft_nstac_report_on_addressing_the_abuse_of_domestic_infrastructure-508c__;!!ApXA7kLm!zyHCzarWQx2aQ7cmUHeaEU_2Tfyu8ZmtuValhyaybo_n5AuV3tm3SSpaZulRBPgmK6ceNsWE8hLhlg0Y6MIxw1c$). 
    
-   Speaking of government-industry clashes, it looks like Apple is caught between Chinese demands that it impose tough new controls on apps in its app store and, well, human decency. Maury has the story. And I’ve got a solution. Apple should just rebrand its totalitarian new controls as “app curation.” Seems to be working for everyone else.
