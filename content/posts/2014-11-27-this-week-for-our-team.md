# This week for our team

<br/>

<br/>
This weekend we are going to take part in three on-site final challenges.

First one is **D-CTF 2014 Final** at DefCamp Conference (http://defcamp.ro/) on information security, Bucharest, Romania. 

The second is **CSCAMP CTF 2014 Final** held at Cairo, Egypt (http://www.cairosecuritycamp.com/).

And third one is **PRO-IB** competition - it is Russian national contest on information security business-cases for students (http://www.pro-ib.org/). So our youngest members will be there. They qualified for final with first place in preliminary rating.

Hope it is not bad idea to deal so widely - three finals at one time. It will be hard. But anyway we got qualified for all three events not for missing such possibilities.

Big thanks to our sponsor [Innopolis University](http://university.innopolis.ru/) for supporting our trip to CSCAMP CTF 2014 Final. 

Hope we will win some money and cover expenses for other trips :)

One more thing... This week our team celebrates 2-years birthday. Sure that
