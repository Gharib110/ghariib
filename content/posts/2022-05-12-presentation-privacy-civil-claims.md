# Presentation Privacy civil claims

<br/>

<br/>
I had the honour this week of presenting to a continuing education event for judges on privacy civil claims, past, present and future. I was jointed by [Antoine Aylwin](https://www.fasken.com/en/antoine-aylwin) and [Erika Chamberlain](https://law.uwo.ca/about_us/faculty/erika_chamberlain.html).

To make it a little more daunting, some of the judges who wrote the decisions I referred to were in the room...

It may be of interest to the privacy nerds who follow my blog, so here's the presentation:

<!-- google\_ad\_client = "pub-2534906746401214"; //728x15, created 12/29/07 google\_ad\_slot = "1518476471"; google\_ad\_width = 728; google\_ad\_height = 15; //-->
