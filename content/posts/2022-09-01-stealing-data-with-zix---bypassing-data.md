# Stealing Data with Zix - Bypassing Data Loss Prevention Policies

<br/>

<br/>
Background If you havenâ€™t done so yet, read my first Zix exploitation article: Spear Phishing with Zix: An Undisclosed Red Team Method for the Hungry APT, which established baselines to abuse the native organizational trust that Zix provides to perform spear phishing on the affected company. Shortly after the spear phishing writeup, I discovered that Zix is also an excellent data exfiltration tool. The innate trust that Zix Secure Messaging provides allows an insider threat or threat actor with internal access to the network to bypass organizational data loss prevention controls (DLP) with ease.
