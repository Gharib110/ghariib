# Evilginx 21 - The First Post-Release Update

<br/>

<br/>
About 2 months ago, [I've released Evilginx 2](https://breakdev.org/evilginx-2-next-generation-of-phishing-2fa-tokens/). Since then, a lot of you reported issues or wished for specific features.

Your requests have been heard! I've finally managed to find some time during the weekend to address the most pressing matters.
