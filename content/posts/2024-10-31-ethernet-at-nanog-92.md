# Ethernet at NANOG 92

<br/>

<br/>
Ethernet has been the mainstay of much of the networking environment for almost 50 years now, but that doesn't mean that it’s remained unchanged over that period. The evolution of this technology has featured continual increases in the scale of Ethernet networks, increasing in capacity, reach and connections. I’d like to report on a couple of Ether-related presentations that took place at the recent NANOG 92 meeting, held in Toronto in October 2024 that described some recent developments in Ethernet.
