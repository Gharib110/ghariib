		<p>Most countries have some sort of government agency dedicated to protecting digital infrastructure and promoting cybersecurity awareness. In the English-speaking world alone, the UK has the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), the US has the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST), and Canada has the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security; chances are you’re already aware of them. However, cybersecurity knows no borders. Expanding our knowledge beyond the anglosphere is crucial to working effectively in the modern world. With this in mind, let’s look at one of the most important&hellip;</p>

		<p>Attackers always seek the easiest path to get into our systems and compromise data. System misconfigurations and insecure default settings are often the criminals&rsquo; favorite vectors since these errors allow them easy access to critical systems and data. The rise of misconfiguration errors was primarily driven by cloud data storage implementations deployed without appropriate access controls. Despite the efforts of the major cloud providers to make the default configurations more secure, these errors persist. Organizations have many good reasons to locate and remediate insecure configurations&hellip;</p>

		<p>System hardening means locking down a system and reducing its attack surface: removing unnecessary software packages, securing default values to the tightest possible settings and configuring the system to only run what you explicitly require.</p>

<p>Let’s take an example from daily life. A jewellery store and a grocery shop are located next to each other, but of course, you would expect that the jewellery store has much beefier bars and stronger locks that are shut when the shop is closed for the night as the contents are more valuable. In this case, the jewellery shop building has been hardened to protect precious products and deter thieves.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Managing state in React applications can quickly become complex, especially as your application grows. One of the most common questions developers face is when and how to split their reducers. Let&rsquo;s dive into this topic with real-world examples and practical advice.</p>
<h4 id="the-single-reducer-pattern-when-it-works-and-when-it-doesnt">The Single Reducer Pattern: When It Works and When It Doesn&rsquo;t</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a common scenario: an e-commerce dashboard that manages both UI state (like modal visibility, selected tabs) and data state (product inventory, orders). Initially, you might start with a single reducer:</p>
