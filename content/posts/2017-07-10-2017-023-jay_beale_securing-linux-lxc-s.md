Jay Beale works for a pentest firm called "Inguardians", and has always been a fierce friend of the show. He's running a class at both BlackHat and Defcon all about hardening various parts of the Linux OS. This week, we discuss some of the concepts he teaches in the class. 

Why do we disable Selinux? Is it as difficult to enable as everyone believes? What benefit do we get from using it? 

We also discuss other hardening applications, like ModSecurity for Apache, Suhosin for PHP, and Linux Containers (LXC). What is gained by using these, and how can we use these to our advantage?

Really great discussion with Jay, and please sign up for his class for a two day in-depth discussion of all the technologies discussed on the show.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System\_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call)

“In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a **system call** is the programmatic way in which a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) requests a service from the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_\(computing\)) of the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive)), creation and execution of new [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_\(computing\)), and communication with integral [kernel services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_service) such as [process scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_scheduling). System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.”
