# 2016-040 Gene_Kim Josh_Corman helping DevOps and Infosec to play nice

<br/>

<br/>
If you work in a #DevOps environment, you're on one side of the fence... you're either with the devs, you have freedom to make changes, and everything is great.

If you're on the Security and/or Compliance side, it's a desolate wasteland of watching people play fast and loose with policies, no one documenting anything, and you're seen as a 'barrier' to getting the new hotness out.

But does it have to be that way? This week, we sat down with DevOps veterans Gene Kim and Josh Corman to discuss how we can make security, compliance, and DevOps to play nice with one another.
