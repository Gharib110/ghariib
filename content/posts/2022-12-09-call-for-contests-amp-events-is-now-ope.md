We’ve got a big DEF CON 31 announcement - the official [Call for Contests and Events](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfce.html) is OPEN!  
  
Now is the time to take the secret ideas you’ve been percolating and share them with us. We’re looking for new ideas and cool twists on more familiar ones. Pitch us something good and we’ll work with you to perfect it and get it on the floor in Las Vegas.  
  
The rules and requirements await your examination. Hit us up with any questions at info@defcon.org.  
  
We can’t wait to see what you’ve got brewing.
