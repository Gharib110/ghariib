# 2015-046 Getting Security baked in your web app using OWASP ASVS

<br/>

<br/>
During our last podcast with Bill Sempf (@sempf), we were talking about how to get developers to understand how to turn a vuln into a defect and how to get a dev to understand how vulns affect the overall quality of the product.

During our conversation, a term "ASVS" came up. So we did a quick and dirty session with Bill about this.  It's a security #requirements #document that ensures that projects that are being scoped out are meeting specific security requirements. This can be a valuable ally when your company is creating products or software applications. Bill explains with us this week exactly how you incorporate this into your Secure #SDLC #lifecycle
