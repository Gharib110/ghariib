# How worried should we be about existential AI risk

<br/>

<br/>
The “godfather of AI” has left Google, offering warnings about [the existential risks for humanity of the technology](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html?utm_source=pocket_saves). [Mark MacCarthy](https://cbpp.georgetown.edu/people/mark-maccarthy/) calls those risks a fantasy, and a debate breaks out between Mark, [Nate Jones,](https://culperpartners.com/) and me. There’s more agreement on [the White House summit](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-microsoft-openai-ceos-attend-white-house-ai-meeting-official-2023-05-02/?utm_source=pocket_saves) on AI risks, which seems to have followed Mark’s “let’s worry about tomorrow tomorrow” prescription. I think existential risks are a bigger concern, but I am deeply skeptical about other efforts to regulate AI, especially for bias, as [readers of Cybertoonz know](https://reason.com/volokh/2023/05/08/the-white-house-holds-an-ai-summit/). I argue again that regulatory efforts to eliminate bias are an ill-disguised effort to impose quotas more widely, which provokes lively pushback from [Jim Dempsey](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/people/james-x-dempsey) and Mark.

Other prospective AI regulators, from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s [Lina Khan](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/opinion/ai-lina-khan-ftc-technology.html?utm_source=pocket_saves) to the [Italian data protection agency](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23709833/openai-chatgpt-gdpr-ai-regulation-europe-eu-italy), come in for commentary. I’m struck by the caution both have shown, perhaps due to their recognizing [the difficulty of applying](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/04/eu-urged-to-protect-grassroots-ai-research-or-risk-losing-out-to-us?utm_source=pocket_saves) old regulatory frameworks to this new technology. It’s not, I suspect, because Lina Khan’s FTC has lost its enthusiasm for pushing the law further than it can be pushed. This week’s example of litigation overreach at the FTC include [a dismissed complaint in a location data case against Kochava](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/05/business/ftc-kochava-location-data.html?utm_source=pocket_saves), and a [wildly disproportionate ‘remedy”](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/ftc-proposes-barring-meta-from-monetizing-kids-data.html?utm_source=pocket_saves) for what look like Facebook foot faults in complying with an earlier FTC order. 

Jim brings us up to date on a [slew of new state privacy laws](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/fpf.org/blog/tenn-makes-nine-tennessee-information-protection-act-set-to-become-newest-comprehensive-state-privacy-law/__;!!ApXA7kLm!zV0_YuUlKhtu8JRAbT30meixL1EjWb-Y80IqUS_YTbSTaddpAgomGjG_waN58-luHzkah058ZksJ97Hitg5RGfj8$) in Montana, Indiana, and Tennessee. Jim sees them as [business-friendly alternatives](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.perkinsonprivacy.com/2023/05/lucky-number-78-and-9-indiana-passes-privacy-law-with-tennessee-and-montana-hot-on-its-heels/__;!!ApXA7kLm!zV0_YuUlKhtu8JRAbT30meixL1EjWb-Y80IqUS_YTbSTaddpAgomGjG_waN58-luHzkah058ZksJ97HitsyGJJCH$) to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California’s privacy law. Mark reviews [Pornhub’s reaction to the Utah law on kids’ access to porn.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.vice.com/en/article/93kbkv/pornhub-blocks-utah-age-verification?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!2nTtspYuzO-4GRaO4B5jw-OIYkgd-wgaFT1kPOFWfjrIUH8e1Qr2uzds0H2zCyTeyus8mjtfPIZ0iMGG3tNGkA$) He thinks age verification requirements are due for another look by the courts.  

Jim explains the [state appellate court decision](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mercks-insurers-on-the-hook-in-1-4-billion-notpetya-attack-court-says-528aeb01?utm_source=pocket_saves) ruling that the NotPetya attack on Merck was not an act of war and thus not excluded from its insurance coverage.

Nate and I recommend Kim Zetter’s revealing story on the  [SolarWinds hack.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-untold-story-of-solarwinds-the-boldest-supply-chain-hack-ever/?utm_source=pocket_saves) The details help to explain why the Cyber Safety Review Board hasn’t examined SolarWinds—and why it absolutely has to—because the full story is going to embarrass a lot of powerful institutions.

In quick hits, 

-   Mark makes a bold prediction about the fate of [Canada’s law requiring Google and Facebook to pay](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/canada-online-news-bill-is-unreasonable-google-executive-says-2023-05-03/) when they link to Canadian media stories: Just like in Australia, the tech giants and the industry will reach a deal. 
    
-   Jim and I comment on the three-year probation sentence for Joe Sullivan in the Uber “misprision of felony” case—and the sentencing judge’s wide-ranging commentary. 
    
-   I savor the impudence of the [hacker who has broken into Russian intelligence’s bitcoin wallets](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/27/russian-bitcoin-wallets-allegedly-exposed-by-apparent-hacker/?utm_source=pocket_saves) and burned the money to post messages doxing the agencies involved.
    
-   And for those who missed it, Rick Salgado and I wrote [a Lawfare article](https://www.lawfareblog.com/cisos-dont-ignore-fisa-section-702-debate) on why CISOs should support renewal of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) section 702, and [Metacurity](https://metacurity.substack.com/p/best-infosec-related-long-reads-of-6a2) named it one of the week’s “Best Infosec-related Long Reads.”
