# 2015-013-Hackerspaces and their sense of community

<br/>

<br/>
We invited the organizers of the "TheLab.ms", a Dallas, Texas based hacker/makerspace on the podcast to talk about why they wanted to start a makerspace, the costs and plans to setup a hacker space, and some of the things you can do with a makerspace. We also understand the sense of community and the learning environment gained from these places.Â 

If you are looking to start a 'space in your area, or looking to understand why they are needed in a community, you'll want to listen to Roxy, Sean, and Jarrod talk about the highs and lows and even some of the gotchas in setting up a space.
