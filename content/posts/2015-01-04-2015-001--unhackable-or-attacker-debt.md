# 2015-001- unhackable or attacker debt

<br/>

<br/>
This is a quick little podcast I did without Mr. Boettcher about a Twitter discussion that occurred when Dr. Neil Degrasse Tyson mentioned that we should just make computers 'unhackable'.

The first episode of the 2015 season of Brakeing Down Security is here!
