# XSS in Azure Bastion and Container Registry

<br/>

<br/>
Orca discovered vulnerabilities in Azure Bastion and Azure Container Registry that could have enabled an attacker to achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by using iframe postMessages. The vulnerabilities allowed embedding of endpoints within remote attacker-controlled servers using the iframe tag, thereby granting unauthorized access to the victimâ€™s session in the affected service if they were tricked into navigating to an attacker-controlled website. The root cause was that certain web pages in the Bastion and Container Registry customer-facing portals allowed embedding of iframes in remote servers, meaning they were not using mitigations such as the X-Frame-Options header or the frame-ancestors directive in a Content Security Policy (CSP), which would have prevented these issues.
