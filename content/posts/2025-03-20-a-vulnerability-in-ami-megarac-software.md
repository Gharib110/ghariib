# A Vulnerability in AMI MegaRAC Software Could Allow for Remote Code Execution

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability has been discovered in AMI MegaRAC Software, which could allow for remote code execution. MegaRAC is a product line of BMC firmware packages and formerly service processors providing out-of-band, or lights-out remote management of computer systems. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised server, remotely deploy malware, ransomware, firmware tampering, bricking motherboard components (BMC or potentially BIOS/UEFI), potential server physical damage (over-voltage / bricking), and indefinite reboot loops that a victim cannot stop.
