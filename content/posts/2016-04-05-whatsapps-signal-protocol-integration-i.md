At Open Whisper Systems, our goal is to make private communication simple. A year ago, we [announced a partnership](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp/) with WhatsApp and committed to integrating the Signal Protocol into their product, moving towards full end-to-end encryption for all of their users by default.

Over the past year, we’ve been progressively rolling out Signal Protocol support for all WhatsApp communication across all WhatsApp clients. This includes chats, group chats, attachments, voice notes, and voice calls across Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60, Blackberry, and BB10.

As of today, the integration is [fully complete](https://www.whatsapp.com/security). Users running the most recent versions of WhatsApp on any platform now get full end-to-end encryption for every message they send and every WhatsApp call they make when communicating with each other. This includes all the benefits of the Signal Protocol – a modern, open source, forward secure, [strong encryption protocol](https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/) for asynchronous messaging systems, designed to make end-to-end encrypted messaging as seamless as possible.
