GreyNoise has observed exploitation attempts targeting two Cisco vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2018-0171. CVE-2023-20198 is being actively exploited by over 110 malicious IPs, primarily from Bulgaria, Brazil, and Singapore, while CVE-2018-0171 has seen exploitation attempts from two malicious IPs traced to Switzerland and the United States.
