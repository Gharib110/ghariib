# The Eagle Has Not Landed

We've had some questions about our [warrant canary](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-canary.html), and we wanted to let everyone know that it was just an accidental reversion to the previous version during a site wide update. We're putting some measures in place to avoid this kind of confusion in the future, but rest assured, all is well, and no action has been taken against us!
