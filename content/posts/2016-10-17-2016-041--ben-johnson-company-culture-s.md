# 2016-041- Ben Johnson company culture shifts job descriptions cyber self-esteem

<br/>

<br/>
Ben Johnson has been around the industry for a good while, and has seen a lot of ugly things in our industry.

Ben had written a recent blog post ([https://www.carbonblack.com/2016/08/12/benvlog-3-negative-forces-driving-security/)](https://www.carbonblack.com/2016/08/12/benvlog-3-negative-forces-driving-security/\)) detailing the issues that seem to plague many companies and many people in the infosec community.

We talked about these issues in depth, and how companies and even the employees in a company can ease some of their burdens, and how they can make some changes to make your company culture better.
