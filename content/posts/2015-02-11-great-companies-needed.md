# Great Companies Needed

<br/>

<br/>
My good friend and colleague **John List** has very ambitious summer plans.

We’ve both believed for a long time that the combination of creative economic thinking and randomized experiments has the potential to revolutionize business and the non-profit sector. John and I have worked to foment that revolution through both  academic partnerships with firms as well as a project of John's called the [Science of Philanthropy Initiative (SPI)](http://spihub.org/), whose mission is "evidence-based research on charitable giving."
