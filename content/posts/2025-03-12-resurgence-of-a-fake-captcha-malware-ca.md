# Resurgence of a Fake Captcha Malware Campaign

<br/>

<br/>
During an [Advanced Continual Threat Hunt (ACTH)](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/services/threat-hunting/) investigation in early February 2025, [Trustwave SpiderLabs](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/company/about-us/spiderlabs/) discovered a resurgence of fake CAPTCHA verifications designed to deceive victims into executing malicious PowerShell scripts. This campaign employs a multi-stage PowerShell execution process, ultimately delivering infostealers such as Lumma and Vidar.
