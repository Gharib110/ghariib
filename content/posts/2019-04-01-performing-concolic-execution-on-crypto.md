# Performing Concolic Execution on Cryptographic Primitives

<br/>

<br/>
Alan Cao For my winternship and springternship at Trail of Bits, I researched novel techniques for symbolic execution on cryptographic protocols. I analyzed various implementation-level bugs in cryptographic libraries, and built a prototype Manticore-based concolic unit testing tool, Sandshrew, that analyzed C cryptographic primitives under a symbolic and concrete environment. Sandshrew is a first step \[â€¦\]
