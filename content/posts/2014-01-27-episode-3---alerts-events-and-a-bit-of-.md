# Episode 3 - Alerts Events and a bit of incident response

<br/>

<br/>
In this issue, we talked about upcoming podcasts with Michael Gough from MI2 Security discussing malware, and this week we get into everything about alerts, why they are important, types of alerts, levels that can occur, and even a bit of incident response in handling alerts.
