Seth Blank, CTO of Valimail, joins to discuss the implications on email security on behalf of DMARC. Joe and Dave share some follow up regarding Meta, who is the parent company to Facebook and Instagram, and how they are now in a lawsuit over steering predators to children in New Mexico. Joe shares how he was almost hacked, as scammers used Peacock to lure him in. Dave's story continues with popular streaming apps being impersonated, this time with Disney+ falling victim. Joe's story follows the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the FBI, and State and Local Law Enforcement Officials sharing another "Don't click December" PSA. Our catch of the day comes from listener Mauricio, who writes in sharing a phishing email, from "PayPal," saying he has an invoice of almost $600.
