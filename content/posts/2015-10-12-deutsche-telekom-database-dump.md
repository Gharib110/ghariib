# Deutsche Telekom Database Dump

<br/>

<br/>
Here is a simple and critical vulnerability I’ve found in Deutsche Telekom allowed me to dump the database due to Authorization bypass. The web application main page is the login page: demandplan.telekom.de/identification.php I opened the web page source and there were some php file names inside javascript such as index.php, adminuser.php, ProjectExport.php and so on.. \[…\]
