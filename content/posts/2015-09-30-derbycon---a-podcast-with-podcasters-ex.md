# Derbycon - A podcast with Podcasters explicit

<br/>

<br/>
Mr. Boettcher and I attended Derbycon, and while he was out attending talks, I got invited to do a podcast with some of the other podcasts who were there.  Special thanks to Edgar Rojas, Amanda Berlin, Jerry Bell, Andrew Kalat, Paul Coggin, Tim DeBlock, and everyone else at our recording.  We have a bit more audio that we will post this month, including a discussion of a tool Mr. Boettcher and Michael Gough collaborated on to make windows malware analysis easier to do.
