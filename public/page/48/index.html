		<p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is pleased to launch key-level filtering for AWS KMS API usage in Amazon CloudWatch metrics, providing enhanced visibility to help customers improve their operational efficiency and aid in security and compliance risk management.</p>
<p>AWS KMS currently publishes account-level AWS KMS API usage metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, enabling you to monitor and manage your API usage. However, if you’re using numerous KMS keys, pinpointing the ones with the highest request rate quota usage or significant API costs becomes challenging. For example, if you have more than 10 active KMS keys in your account, prior to this launch you would have needed to build a custom CloudTrail and Amazon Athena based solution to locate which specific keys are driving the majority of API usage and costs. With the new CloudWatch metrics, which are available under the <code>AWS/KMS</code> namespace in CloudWatch, you can track, understand, and set alerts on detailed API usage at the individual KMS key level without building a costly customized solution.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries like healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and even autonomous vehicles—making our daily lives hyperconnected. But as more devices come online, relying solely on cloud computing can lead to slow response times, high bandwidth costs and security risks. The traditional cloud-based infrastructure struggles to keep up with the demands of real-time data processing, low latency, and proactive, preventative security. Before we dive in, let me explain what is edge computing is about and how it applies to IoT. Simply put, edge computing processes data right where it’s generated instead of routing it to remote […]</p>

A ‘fresh new look’ is heading to Bodhi Linux, the Ubuntu-based Linux distribution built around the Moksha desktop, a fork of Enlightenment 17. Noting that the look of recent releases has leaned towards the dark side—no, not that one, Darth—the team has decide to give the next release a lighter visual revamp by making a new theme, called Zenithal, default. “Zenithal, developed by Štefan Uram and based on the Ice theme by Simotek, introduces a polished light aesthetic that brings a fresh energy to Moksha. It also marks a first for Bodhi: windows and dialogs with rounded edges,” they say. Bodhi Linux’s […]</p>

<p>In a digital landscape hungry for the next big thing in Artificial Intelligence, a new contender called DeepSeek recently burst onto the scene and has quickly gained traction for its advanced language models.</p>
<p>Positioned as a low-cost alternative to industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, DeepSeek has drawn attention for its rapid growth, affordability, and potential to reshape the AI landscape.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a recent investigation by McAfee Labs found that the same hype is now fueling a barrage of malware attacks disguised as DeepSeek software and updates.</p>
