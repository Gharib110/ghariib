# Putting the SEC in Infosec

<br/>

<br/>
In a law-packed Cyberlaw Podcast episode, [Chris Conte](https://www.steptoe.com/en/lawyers/christopher-conte.html) walks us through [the long, detailed, and justifiably controversial SEC enforcement action](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/10/30/solarwinds-computer-breach-sec-russia/?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!w9c8jFrhgf0TqFDvIu9ISdrHou8pqgxqmb62_N8b9_NwUinPx_bP9sj0EZrFW9_UjPwb2OqfYBT2mM3ezfyt$) against SolarWinds and its top infosec officer, Tim Brown. It sounds to me as though the SEC’s [explanation for its action](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-227.pdf?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!w9c8jFrhgf0TqFDvIu9ISdrHou8pqgxqmb62_N8b9_NwUinPx_bP9sj0EZrFW9_UjPwb2OqfYBT2mOl5Y-pK$) will (1) force companies to examine and update all of their public security documents, (2) transmit a lot more of their security engineers’ concerns to top management, and (3) quite possibly lead to disclosures beyond those required by the SEC’s new cyber disclosure rules that would alert network attackers to what security officials know about the attack in something close to real time. 

[Jim Dempsey](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/people/james-x-dempsey) does a deep dive into [the administration’s executive order on AI](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.politico.com/news/2023/10/27/white-house-ai-executive-order-00124067?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!w9c8jFrhgf0TqFDvIu9ISdrHou8pqgxqmb62_N8b9_NwUinPx_bP9sj0EZrFW9_UjPwb2OqfYBT2mG1kbiun$), adding details not available last week when we went live. It’s surprisingly regulatory, while still trying to milk [jawboning and public-private partnership](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/technology/executive-order-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html__;!!ApXA7kLm!w9c8jFrhgf0TqFDvIu9ISdrHou8pqgxqmb62_N8b9_NwUinPx_bP9sj0EZrFW9_UjPwb2OqfYBT2mOS0sHS1$) for all they’re worth. The _order_ more or less guarantees a flood of detailed regulatory and quasiregulatory initiatives for the rest of the President’s first term. Jim resists our efforts to mock the even more in-the-weeds OMB guidance, saying it will drive federal AI contracting in significant ways. He’s a little more willing, though, to diss the [Bletchley Park announcement](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/global-ai-cybersecurity-agreement-signed-at-turing-s-bletchley-park-?utm_source=pocket_saves__;!!ApXA7kLm!w9c8jFrhgf0TqFDvIu9ISdrHou8pqgxqmb62_N8b9_NwUinPx_bP9sj0EZrFW9_UjPwb2OqfYBT2mG560M_c$) on AI principles that was released by a large group of countries. It doesn’t say all that much, and what it does say isn’t binding. 

[David Kris](https://culperpartners.com/) covers the Supreme Court’s foray into cyberlaw this week – oral argument in two cases about when politicians can curate the audience that interacts with their social media sites. This started as a Trump issue, David reminds us, but it has lost its predictable partisan valence, so now [it’s just a surprisingly hard constitutional controversy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/31/supreme-court-social-media-block-critics/) that, as Justice Elena Kagan almost said, left the Supreme Court building littered with first amendment rights.

Finally, I drop in on Europe to see how that Brussels Effect is doing. Turns out that, after years of huffing and puffing, the [privacy bureaucrats are dropping the hammer](https://iapp.org/news/a/edpb-issues-binding-decisions-banning-metas-targeted-advertising-practices/) on Facebook’s data-fueled advertising model. In a move that raises doubts about how far from Brussels the Brussels Effect can reach, [Facebook is changing its business model](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/meta-faces-eu-ban-on-facebook-instagram-targeted-advertising/?utm_source=pocket_saves), but just for Europe, where kids won’t get ads and grownups will have the dubious option of paying about ten bucks a month for Facebook and Insta. Another straw in the wind: Ordered by the French government to drop Russian government news channels, [YouTube competitor Rumble has decided to drop France instead](https://europeanconservative.com/articles/news/youtube-competitor-pulls-plug-on-france-over-government-demands/?utm_source=pocket_saves).
