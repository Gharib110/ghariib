		<p>Good news for growing businesses and folks with data-intensive applications: we’re excited to introduce 100% larger storage plans for both Managed MySQL and PostgreSQL in select regions. Starting today, Managed MySQL storage has doubled to 20TB, and Managed PostgreSQL now supports up to 30TB, up from 15TB. These expanded storage options are available in Singapore (SGP1), San Francisco (SFO2), and Frankfurt (FRA1), with plans to roll out to more regions later this year.</p>

		<p>The GitLab Security Operations team prioritizes automation that enables security engineers to focus on high-impact work rather than routine tasks that can be automated. A key innovation in this automation strategy is creation of the User Attestation Module (UAM), which allows GitLab team members to directly respond to and verify security alerts flagged as potentially malicious. When the GUARD framework detects suspicious activity, it routes the alert to the relevant team member for review. The team member can then attest whether they recognize and authorize the activity. Their response is recorded for audit purposes, and, based on their input, the system either closes the alert or escalates it to the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT).</p>

<h2 id="what-inspired-you-to-join-digitalocean">What inspired you to join DigitalOcean?</h2>
<p>I studied finance in college and started my career as an equity research analyst working for an asset management company. I wanted to work for a fast-growing and innovative company where I could make an impact. So, I switched careers and joined Digitalocean in 2019. There’s a lot of growth potential for this company, driven by digital transformation and companies moving to the cloud.</p>

	<div>
		<p>2025 marks the year in which officials start to understand the importance of encryption! Following the example of America’s Cyberdefence Agency (CISA), the Swedish Armed Forces have issued a new directive requiring the use of the Signal app for calls and messages whenever possible. The decision underscores the increasing need for end-to-end encryption in the face of growing cyber threats and state-level surveillance.</p>

		<p>Imagine building an LLM-powered assistant trained on your developer documentation and some internal guides to quickly help customers, reduce support workload, and improve user experience. Sounds great, right? But what if sensitive data, such as employee details or internal discussions, is included in the data used to train the LLM? Attackers could manipulate the assistant into exposing sensitive data or exploit it for social engineering attacks, where they deceive individuals or systems into revealing confidential details, or use it for targeted phishing attacks. Suddenly, your helpful AI tool turns into a serious security liability. </p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>With financial stress at an all-time high, and many Americans grappling with confusion about social security, Medicaid, and Medicare, people are desperately seeking relief. Scammers know this all too well and have tailored their tactics to exploit these fears, preying on vulnerable individuals with promises of “free money.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s a so-called “subsidy program,” a “government grant,” or a “relief card,” these scams all share the same underlying goal—to manipulate people into giving away their personal information, or—worse—their hard-earned cash. </p>

		<p>As companies rapidly adopt AI technologies, CISOs face a new frontier of security challenges. Many security leaders find themselves grappling with unfamiliar questions: How do we evaluate AI vendors differently from traditional software vendors? What security controls matter most? Where does vendor responsibility end and customer responsibility begin? How do we evaluate AI security risks within the context of the service provided? To help answer these questions, we’ve created the GitLab AI Security Framework to show security leaders how GitLab and customers enable secure AI-powered development using GitLab Duo.</p>

<p>For an internal event atCryptomathic, we invited some our clients from the financial and trust service sectors to share their insight on future trends around our solutions. We had expected topics such as post quantum cryptography, the use of confidential computing to secure the transition to cloud, targeted threats from groups that want to destabilise high street banks and the economy to be the number one concern.</p>
