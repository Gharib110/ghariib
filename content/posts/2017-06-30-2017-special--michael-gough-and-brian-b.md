# 2017-SPECIAL- Michael Gough and Brian Boettcher discuss specific ransomware

<br/>

<br/>
Due to popular demand, we are adding the extra content from last week's show as a standalone podcast.

Michael Gough (@hackerHurricane) and Mr. Boettcher (BrakeSec Co-Host, and @boettcherpwned) sit down and discuss the popularity of ransomware as a topic

They discuss what email attachments to block, how to test your own email gateway, and what controls you should implement to help defend against the #petya #notpetya ransomware.
