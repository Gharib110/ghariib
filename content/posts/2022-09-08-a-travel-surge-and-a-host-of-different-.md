# A travel surge and a host of different scams

<br/>

<br/>
Greg Otto from Intel 471 joins Dave to discuss the findings of their work on "Cybercriminals preying on a travel surge with a host of different scams." Dave and Joe share some interesting listener follow up from Kevin, who writes in about the deepfakes episode and shares his comments on how scary the topic can be, especially with politicians. Dave shares a story about Charles Egunjobi, an auditor with the D.C. government, and how he fell victim to an online love scam costing elderly U.S. citizens $1.9 million. Joe touches on two stories, one being how a woman down in Texas is able to scam men out of some expensive items with a romance scam, and the other being a story that is warning Pennsylvania residents on a quick moving scam artist moving from state to state. Our catch of the day comes from Jon in California who writes in about about an email scam concerning a local job sent to him and how he needs to apply right away. Links to stories: D.C. government auditor involved in romance scheme, prosecutors say Texas woman cons men out of Rolex watches and fancy cars through ‘romance scam’ Pennsylvania State Troopers warn of ‘quick moving’ city-to-city scam artists Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
