 Questions and topics: Usable security: is it an oxymoron?

What determines if the security is ‘usable’ or no? We sacrifice security for a better UX, what can be done to alleviate that? Or is it some sort of sliding scale in “poor UX, amazing security or awesome UX, poor security” Examples of poor UX for ‘people’: MFA, and password managers.

SEC updates and ‘material events’ and how that would affect security, IR, and other company reporting functions. 

Also, additional documentation (Regulation S-K Item 106) [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicole-sundin-5225a1149\_sec-adopts-rules-on-cybersecurity-risk-management-activity-7090065804083290112-ISD8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicole-sundin-5225a1149_sec-adopts-rules-on-cybersecurity-risk-management-activity-7090065804083290112-ISD8)

Are companies ready to talk about their cybersecurity? Can the SEC say “you’re not doing enough?”

 What is ‘enough’?

Are we heading toward yet another audit needed for public companies, similar to SOX?

When does an 8-K get publicly disclosed?

Materiality is based on a “reasonable investor”?

So, you don’t need to announce that until you’re certain, and it’s based on what you can collect? Cyber Risk Management and some good examples of how to set up a proper cyber risk organization
