# 2015-031 Fab and Megan-High_Math-Psychology_and Scarves

<br/>

<br/>
Strap yourselves in ladies and Gentlemen.  With Mr. Boettcher gone on "vacation" this week, I needed some help with the podcast, and boy did we pick a doozy.  If you're a fan of Turing Complete algorithms, frankly, who isn't ;) , we had Ms. Fabienne Serrière (@fbz) and Ms. Magen Wu (@tottenkoph) who discuss higher order math and psychology on our podcast this week.

We also discuss a little project management and even talk about why proper survey sizes and getting a good cross-section is important.

Be sure to pick up one of Ms. Fbz's scarves, especially if you're a math nut, and love fracctals and patterns as I do.
