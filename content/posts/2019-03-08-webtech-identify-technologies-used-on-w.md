# WebTech identify technologies used on websites

Introduction
------------

We’re very proud to release WebTech as open-source software.  
WebTech is a Python software that can identify web technologies by visiting a given website, parsing a single response file or replaying a request described in a text file. This way you can have reproducible results and minimize the requests you need to make to a target website.

The RECON phase in a Penetration Test is one among the most important ones. By being able to detect which software runs on the target it’s easier to search for vulnerabilities in a specific module or version.  
WebTech scans websites and detect software and versions in use and can report data in a structured format like JSON or in a grepable text for later analysis.
