# Video 2 BONUS Kismet Video

<br/>

<br/>
As promised, I am posting a video I made explaining how to setup Kismet to do wireless scans.

The only pre-requisites you need are Vmware (it will work the same in VirtualBox), and a VM of Kali linux. The only real difference is the message that asks where the wireless adapter should connect to.

It's my first attempt editing a video, so please be kind
