DEF CON is pleased to announce the return of the Policy Department for DEF CON 29. This means more content for attendees (both in-person and virtual) interested in buidling bridges between the worlds of hackers and policymakers. The Evening Lounge format is back, too! Weâ€™ll be posting all the Policy updates at [The DEF CON 29 Policy Page](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-policy.html), so if this is your thing, make sure to bookmark it and check back often.
