# Linux Privilege Escalation Quick and Dirty

<br/>

<br/>
Linux Privilege Escalation: Quick and Dirty Automated Tooling Usually, my approach is to use an automated tool in conjunction with some manual enumeration. However, you can completely accomplish the Privilege Escalation process from an automated tool paired with the right exploitation methodology. 1. Linpeas.sh (my go-to, fully automated) https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS 2. Linprivchecker.py (my backup) https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker/blob/master/linuxprivchecker.py 3. Linux-Exploit-Suggest-2.pl (To look for those sneaky little Kernel Exploits) https://github.com/jondonas/linux-exploit-suggester-2 Resources Keep in mind, that these are just some of the techniques I have used.
