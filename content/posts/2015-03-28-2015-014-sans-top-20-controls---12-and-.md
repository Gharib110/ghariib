# 2015-014-SANS Top 20 Controls - 12 and 13

<br/>

<br/>
We continue our trek down the list of SANS Top 20 Critical Security Controls this week with #12 and #13 - Boundry Defense, and Controlled use of Administrative Privileges. Â Learn what you can do to shore up your network defenses, and how to handle admin privileges... When to give that kind of access, and how to make privileged access as secure as possible while still allowing administrators to do their work.
