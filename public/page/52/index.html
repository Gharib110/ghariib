		<p>AI is transforming businesses — from automated agents performing background workflows, to improved search, to easier access and summarization of knowledge. </p>
<p>While we are still early in what is likely going to be a substantial shift in how the world operates, two things are clear: the Internet, and how we interact with it, will change, and the boundaries of security and data privacy have never been more difficult to trace, making security an important topic in this shift.</p>

<p><strong>February 26, 2025</strong>: We’ve updated this post to fix a typo in the code in <strong>Step 5 – Deploy your workload</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Many customers want to seamlessly integrate their on-premises Kubernetes workloads with AWS services, implement hybrid workloads, or migrate to AWS. Previously, a common approach involved creating long-term access keys, which posed security risks and is no longer recommended. While solutions such as Kubernetes secrets vault and third-party options exist, they fail to address the underlying issue effectively.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Quantum computers are actively being developed that will eventually have the ability to break the cryptography we rely on for securing modern communications. Recent breakthroughs in quantum computing have underscored the vulnerability of conventional cryptography to these attacks. Since 2017, Cloudflare has been at the forefront of developing, standardizing, and implementing post-quantum cryptography to withstand attacks by quantum computers. </p>
<p>Our mission is simple: we want every Cloudflare customer to have a clear path to quantum safety. Cloudflare recognizes the urgency, so we’re committed to managing the complex process of upgrading cryptographic algorithms, so that you don’t have to worry about it. We&rsquo;re not just talking about doing it. Over 35% of the non-bot HTTPS traffic that touches Cloudflare today is post-quantum secure. </p>

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
