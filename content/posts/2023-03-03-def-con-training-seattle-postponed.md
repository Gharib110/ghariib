# DEF CON Training Seattle Postponed

The DEF CON Training Event in Seattle is being postponed - instead of April, we’ll hold it in Q4 of this year. Exact dates will be announced soon.  
  
We apologize for any disruption or confusion this causes. We hope this change will give more people the opportunity to attend, with a few quarters of distance from the tech sector’s current uncertainty.  
  
This means the first DEF CON Training event of 2023 will happen in Las Vegas, and we hope you’ll join us for that if you’re in town.
