# 12 Days of DigitalOcean Day 7 - Building and Deploying the Email-Based Receipt Processor

<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to **Day 7 of the 12 Days of DigitalOcean**! Today, we‚Äôre kicking off the second project in this series: an **Email-Based Receipt Processing Service**. This app is designed to make your life a little easier by organizing your emailed receipts into a database. No more endless scrolling through your inbox to find that one receipt you need.

If you enjoyed the [Birthday Reminder Service](/community/tutorials/setting-up-postgresql-database-for-birthday-reminders), you‚Äôll love this next step. It‚Äôs another practical, production-ready app that highlights how DigitalOcean can help you turn ideas into real, working solutions. By the end of this tutorial, your Flask app will be live on the web and ready to process receipt data like a pro.

[‚ú® Why This App?](#why-this-app)[](#why-this-app)
-------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîscrambling to find a specific receipt for tax season or reimbursements. It‚Äôs not fun. This app aims to solve that by automating the whole process.

[**How the App Works**](#how-the-app-works)[](#how-the-app-works)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **You forward a receipt to a specific email address.**
2.  **The app extracts details** like the vendor, amount, and date using smart tools.
3.  **Those details are stored in a database**, like [PostgreSQL](/community/tutorials/setting-up-postgresql-database-for-birthday-reminders), where they‚Äôre neatly organized.
4.  **You get a confirmation**‚Äîvia email or SMS‚Äîonce the receipt is processed.

It‚Äôs simple, efficient, and takes a tedious task off your plate. **Today**, we‚Äôre focusing on building the backend system with Flask, setting it up for production with [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org), and deploying it to [DigitalOcean‚Äôs App Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/).

[üöÄ What You‚Äôll Learn](#what-you-ll-learn)[](#what-you-ll-learn)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll cover today:

1.  **Set up a Flask app** to serve as the foundation of your receipt processor.
2.  **Configure Gunicorn** to handle production workloads smoothly.
3.  **Use GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
4.  **Deploy the app to [DigitalOcean‚Äôs App Platform](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new)** so it‚Äôs live and ready to use.

This tutorial will give you hands-on experience with deploying a real-world Flask app while keeping things manageable and fun.

[üõ† What You‚Äôll Need](#what-you-ll-need)[](#what-you-ll-need)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Before diving in, make sure you have:

-   A **DigitalOcean account**. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can [sign up here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new).
-   **Python 3.8+** installed on your local machine.
-   **Git** installed and ready to use.

[üßë‚Äçüç≥ Recipe for Day 7: Building and Deploying a Flask App](#recipe-for-day-7-building-and-deploying-a-flask-app)[](#recipe-for-day-7-building-and-deploying-a-flask-app)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Step 1: Set Up Your Flask App](#step-1-set-up-your-flask-app)[](#step-1-set-up-your-flask-app)

Flask will serve as the backbone of this project, handling all incoming requests and processing the receipt data. Let‚Äôs get started by setting up the basics.

1.  **Create Your Project Directory**:  
    Keeping everything in a dedicated folder makes managing your project easier as it grows. Run the following commands to set up the directory:
    
    ```
    mkdir email-receipt-processor
    cd email-receipt-processor
    ```
    
2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:  
    A virtual environment is like a sandbox for your project. It keeps your dependencies isolated, so you don‚Äôt accidentally break other Python projects or your system‚Äôs Python setup.
    
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    ```
    
3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate your virtual environment to install dependencies locally for the project:
    
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
4.  **Install Flask and Gunicorn**:  
    Flask will be your web framework, and Gunicorn will handle production server duties.
    
    ```
    pip install Flask gunicorn
    ```
    
5.  **Save Your Dependencies**:  
    A `requirements.txt` file ensures everyone (and every machine) running your project has the same setup.
    
    ```
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    
6.  **Write Your Flask App**:  
    Let‚Äôs start with a simple Flask app. Create a file called `app.py` and add the following code:
    
    ```
    from flask import Flask
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return "Welcome to the Email-Based Receipt Processor!"
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()
    ```
    
7.  **Test It Locally**:  
    Fire up the app and check it in your browser:
    
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see: **‚ÄúWelcome to the Email-Based Receipt Processor!‚Äù**

### [Step 2: Add Gunicorn Configuration](#step-2-add-gunicorn-configuration)[](#step-2-add-gunicorn-configuration)

Flask‚Äôs built-in server is great for development, but it‚Äôs not designed to handle the traffic and performance needs of a production app. That‚Äôs where Gunicorn comes in.

1.  **Create a Gunicorn Config File**:  
    Gunicorn needs a configuration file to know how to run your app. Create one with:
    
    ```
    touch gunicorn_config.py
    ```
    
2.  **Configure Gunicorn**:  
    Open `gunicorn_config.py` and add:
    
    ```
    bind = "0.0.0.0:8080"
    workers = 2
    ```
    
    -   `bind`: Makes the app accessible over the web on port 8080
    -   `workers`: Sets the number of simultaneous requests the app can handle. Two is a good starting point for small apps.

### [Step 3: Push to GitHub](#step-3-push-to-github)[](#step-3-push-to-github)

GitHub is where the magic happens‚Äîit‚Äôs how we‚Äôll version control the app and integrate it with DigitalOcean.

1.  **Initialize a Git Repository**:  
    A `.gitignore` file prevents unnecessary files (like your virtual environment) from being tracked by Git. Run:
    
    ```
    git init
    echo "venv/" > .gitignore
    echo "*.pyc" >> .gitignore
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial Flask app with Gunicorn"
    ```
    
    ![Terminal Flask App Setup](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/006Community/12-Days-of-DO/Postgressql-birthday/terminal_flask_app_setup.png)
    
    Here‚Äôs what your project should look like in VS Code, for example:
    
    ![VS Code Workspace Setup](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/006Community/12-Days-of-DO/Postgressql-birthday/visual_studio_code_workspace_setup.png)
    
2.  **Create a GitHub Repository**:  
    Head to GitHub, create a new repo called `email-receipt-processor`, and follow the steps to set it up.
    
    ![GitHub Repository Setup Instructions](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/006Community/12-Days-of-DO/Postgressql-birthday/github_repository_setup_instructions.png)
    
3.  **Push Your Code to GitHub**:
    
    Back in your terminal, type:
    
    ```
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/email-receipt-processor.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    

Replace `<your-github-username>` with your **GitHub username**

3.  **Click ‚ÄúConnect GitHub Account‚Äù**: You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize DigitalOcean. If prompted, log into GitHub and grant DigitalOcean access to your repositories.
    
4.  **Select the Repository**: Choose the `email-receipt-processor` repository you created earlier from the list of available repositories. <$>\[note\] **Tip:** Ensure that you have selected the correct branch (e.g., `main`) for deployment. <$>
    
    ![GitHub Repository Permissions](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/006Community/12-Days-of-DO/Postgressql-birthday/github_repository_permissions.png)
    
5.  **Click Save and Continue**: This redirects you back to the DigitalOcean App Platform configuration screen.
    

#### **Configure Deployment Settings**

1.  **Select the Repository from the Dropdown**: Once back in the App Platform, you‚Äôll see a dropdown listing your connected repositories. Select `email-receipt-processor`.
    
    ![Create App Resources from Source](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/006Community/12-Days-of-DO/Postgressql-birthday/create_app_resources_from_source.png)
    
2.  **Choose Resources**: You can adjust the resource allocations (RAM, CPU, and bandwidth) for your app.
    
    -   Click **Edit** to modify these settings. For this tutorial, we recommend the following configuration:
        -   **RAM**: 512 MB
        -   **CPU**: 1vCPU
        -   **Bandwidth**: 50 GB

#### Set the Run Command

1.  **Scroll Down to the Run Command Section**: This step ensures DigitalOcean knows how to start your app in the production environment.
    
2.  **Click ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù**: Replace the default command with the following:
    
    ```
    gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm -c gunicorn_config.py app:app
    ```
    
    -   This command uses Gunicorn to serve your Flask app.
        
    -   The `--worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm` flag optimizes performance in containerized environments.
