# Brakeing DownDefensive Security Mashup

<br/>

<br/>
It's a Super Deluxe sized Brakeing Down Security this week...

It's something you've dreamed of forever (or not), but Jerry Bell and Andrew Kalat from Defensive Security Podcast stopped by and we made ourselves a podcast baby... Boy, was it ugly :)

I'm just kidding, we had a great time discussing some news, and going over what we learned... and any good end-of-year podcast must have predictions...  

We also discussed Sony, caused it's huge news of the year, and talked about Target, because we love dissing PCI... ;)

There might be a few bad words, so if you have small ears around, be advised...

When you're done, check out the other 96 episodes of Defensive Security, and check out our 55 other episodes..
