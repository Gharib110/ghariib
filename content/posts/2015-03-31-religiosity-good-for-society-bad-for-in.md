# Religiosity Good for Society Bad for Innovation

<br/>

<br/>
In a new working paper, **Roland Benabou**, **Davide Ticchi**, and **Andrea Vindigni**Â  follow up [their earlier paper](https://www.princeton.edu/~rbenabou/papers/Religion%20December%201g_snd.pdf) which found "a robust negative association between religiosity and patents per capita." Their new paper, "Religion and Innovation" ([abstract](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21052); [PDF](http://www.princeton.edu/~rbenabou/PP-Article_7.pdf)), they look at religiosity on the individual level, "examining the relationship between religiosity and a broad set of pro- or anti-innovation attitudes."
