# 2015-029 Big Brown cloud honeyblog with theroxyd

<br/>

<br/>
Roxy, who we interviewed a few months ago on our podcast about hackerspaces, is back with us this week to discuss a project she is working on, called 'Big Brown Cloud'. If you've ever wanted to setup your own fake blog and send people to it to gain information on possible attacks, you've come to the right place. Â 

We also get an update on the hackerspace that Jarrod, Sean, and Roxy were getting setup a few months ago. They've come a long way, and they are about to move into their new facility
