<br/>

<br/>
VulnCheck Community provides security and product teams with access to the premier source for open Vulnerability and Exploit Intelligence including VulnCheck KEV, NVD++ and VulnCheck XDB.\\n\\nTo help gain better insight in to the value of VulnCheck community we've put together the top 5 reasons to use VulnCheck Community.\\n\\n## 2,600+ Known Exploited Vulnerabilities\\n\[VulnCheck Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog\](https://vulncheck.com/kev) makes it easy for enterprises, government agencies, and vendors, to know which vulnerabilities have been reported as exploited in the wild. VulnCheck provides citations for each and every CVE, so security teams have a clearer picture of why the vulnerability is on the list.\\n\\n\\n## Fast & Accurate CPE\\nVulnCheck NVD++ delivers the NIST NVD enriched with VulnCheck Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) data to help fill the gap that NVD has left as they slowed processing CVE’s.\\nhttps://vulncheck.com/blog/nvd-cpe\\n\\n## An Enterprise Alternative to NIST NVD\\nWith NIST NVD delivering inconsistent and unreliable service, VulnCheck fills the gap, delivering reliable access to NVD++ and VulnCheck KEV services through enterprise grade API’s that can be accessed by any Vulncheck community member. Documentation on how to use our NVD++ API can be found here:\\n\\nNVD++: https://docs.vulncheck.com/community/nist-nvd/nvd-2\\n\\n## Curated Git Exploits\\nVulnCheck XDB is an index of exploit proof-of-concept code in Git repositories, programmatically compiled with validation steps that involve human analysis and automated block lists to ensure the exploits are valid. \\nhttps://vulncheck.com/xdb/\\n\\n\\n## Free to Use w/ Attribution\\nLeveraging VulnCheck KEV and NVD++ and the data in it, in your own production, solution, or service, is easy to do at no additional cost, but requires prominent attribution to VulnCheck.\\nhttps://docs.vulncheck.com/community/vulncheck-kev/attribution\\n\\n\\n## About VulnCheck\\n\\nVulnCheck is helping organizations not just to solve the vulnerability prioritization challenge - we’re working to help equip any product manager, CSIRT/PSIRT or SecOps team and Threat Hunting team to get faster and more accurate with infinite efficiency using VulnCheck solutions. \\n\\nWe knew that we needed better data, faster across the board, in our industry. So that’s what we deliver to the market. We’re going to continue to deliver key insights on vulnerability management, exploitation and major trends we can extrapolate from our dataset to continuously support practitioners. \\n\\nAre you interested in learning more? If so, VulnCheck's \[Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence\](https://vulncheck.com/product/exploit-intelligence) has broad threat actor coverage. Register and demo our data today.\\n
