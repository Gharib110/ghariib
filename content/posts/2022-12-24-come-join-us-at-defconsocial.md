DEFCON.social is open!  
  
From the first DEF CON announcement over 30 years ago inviting all to attend our first gathering:  
  
"We cordially invite all hackers/phreaks, techno-rats, programmers, writers, activists, lawyers, philosophers, politicians, security officials, cyberpunks and all network sysops and users to attend."  
That's still our core audience, but we welcome artists, musicians, infosec, privacy professionals, journalists, and everyone genuinely curious about how things work.

NOTE: We follow the Mastodon Server Covenant.  
  
DEFCON.social provides for open discussion where different viewpoints are welcome and a high degree of skepticism is expected. However, insulting or harassing others is unacceptable. It’s not about how you look or how hard you meme but what’s in your mind, your ideas, and how you present yourself that matters.  
  
DEF CON grew from the Underground BBS scene of the late 80's into the giant conference of today, and DEFCON.social is another way we seek to support the global hacker community.  
  
We are building a community where you can explore serious issues, ask dumb questions, and make friends along the way. We have a strict Code of Conduct and enforce it. We hope you enjoy yourselves and be kind to others.  
  
Join us at DEFCON.social.
