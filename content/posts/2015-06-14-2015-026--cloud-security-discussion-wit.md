# 2015-026- Cloud Security discussion with FireHost

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we discuss various methods of enabling companies to move applications to cloud based platforms.Â 

We discuss containers, like Docker, and how various hosting services handle converting businesses from a traditional data centers to a secure. cloud based entity.

We even discuss securing the data in the cloud, preventing bad guys from accessing it, as well as the cloud provider themselves, who can be served with a subpeona to hand over data.

Brakeing Down Security would like to thank FireHost for allowing Chase and Mike to join us.
