# 2015-021 24 Deadly Sins Command injection

<br/>

<br/>
We continue our journey on the 24 Deadly Programming Sins. If you listened to last week's podcast, we introduced the book we were using as a study tool:

This week is on command injection. We first discussed command injection as part of our OWASP Top 10 for 2013, but you'll be surprised just how easyÂ devs compile conditions that allow for command injection into their code as well.
