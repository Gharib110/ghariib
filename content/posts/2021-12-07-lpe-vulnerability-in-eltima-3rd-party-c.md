# LPE vulnerability in Eltima 3rd-party cloud desktop driver

<br/>

<br/>
Several cloud desktop solutions rely on a 3rd-party library called Eltima SDK to provide USB over Ethernet capabilities, to allow users to connect and share local devices such as webcams. SentinelLabs discovered vulnerabilities in Eltima drivers, including proprietary versions used by several cloud services (among them AWS Workspaces), that would allow unprivileged users to escalate privileges to kernel mode.
