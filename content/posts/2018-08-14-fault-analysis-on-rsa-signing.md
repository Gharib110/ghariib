# Fault Analysis on RSA Signing

<br/>

<br/>
Aditi Gupta This spring and summer, as an intern at Trail of Bits, I researched modeling fault attacks on RSA signatures. I looked at an optimization of RSA signing that uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and induced calculation faults that reveal private keys. I analyzed fault attacks at a low level rather than in \[â€¦\]
