DEF CON movie night returns 10/3 with another public domain jewel—1950 meta-noir ‘[D.O.A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.O.A._\(1950_film\))’. Decades ahead of its time, DOA subverts the hardened gumshoe genre by forcing the protagonist to solve his own poisoning before he dies. It’s truly one of the greats—don't sleep on this one.
