# Episode 4 Origin stories and talking about reconnaissance

<br/>

<br/>
All superheroes have an origin story, Brian and I are not super, but we have a great origin story.  This week's podcast is about how we made it into the Infosec industry, and we also discuss the value of research from an OS point of view.  We also talk about mentoring and assistance for those looking to get into the InfoSec world.
