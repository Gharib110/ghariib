# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Palo Alto PAN-OS Could Allow for Authentication Bypass

<br/>

<br/>
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Palo Alto PAN-OS, the most severe of which could allow for authentication bypass. PAN-OS is the software that runs all Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls. Successful exploitation could allow for authentication bypass with administrator privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.
