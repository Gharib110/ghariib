# DEF CON Legal Update

We'd like to share the briefest of updates on the Hadnagy lawsuit. The most recent progress is a ruling dismissing six of the plaintiff’s seven claims. Four of the claims were dismissed outright, as was part of Hadnagy's defamation claim, and two were dismissed with leave to amend. Part of the one defamation claim survived our motion to dismiss.  
  
The next move belongs to the plaintiff, as they determine how to proceed on the claims dismissed with leave to amend.  
  
We’ll keep you posted as the remaining claims make their way through the courts.
