Arti is our ongoing project to create a next-generation Tor client in Rust. Now we're announcing the latest release, Arti 1.4.1.

This release has a client-side implementation for [Family IDs](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/321-happy-families.html) (a.k.a. "Happy Families"), which (when used everywhere!) will save relay administrators time and bandwidth. It also starts to lay the groundwork for a full [Conflux](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/329-traffic-splitting.html) implementation, to improve performance by sending traffic over multiple paths.

For full details on what we've done, and for information about many smaller and less visible changes as well, please see the [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#arti-141--3-march-2025).

For more information on using Arti, see our top-level [README](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/README.md), and the documentation for the [`arti` binary](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/tree/main/crates/arti).

Thanks to everybody who's contributed to this release, including kpcyrd and Neel Chauhan.

Also, our deep thanks to all of our [sponsors](https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors/) for funding the development of Arti!
