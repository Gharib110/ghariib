We’re excited to announce something new on the menu for DC 30 - DEF CON Training! We’re launching a lineup of intense two-day trainings taking place August 15-16 in the same venue, and we’re looking for trainers!  
  
**WHAT:** DEF CON We’re seeking Trainers for two-day training sessions right after DEF CON 30.  
  
**WHEN:** August 15-16, the Monday and Tuesday after DEF CON 30.  
  
**WHERE:** Same location, the Caesars Forum.  
  
**WHY:** For DEF CON attendees who love our free Workshop series but wish they could get an even deeper, more focused dive and maybe even a certificate. Like everything we do at DEF CON, we hope it will help to build and strengthen the hacker community and spread the kind of knowledge that makes the world more open and secure.  
  
DEF CON Training will offer two-day paid training courses in the $1-$3k price range. We’re looking for unique, technical, and practical presentations from trainers with deep knowledge of their subject. If that’s you, we’re offering:  
  
\- 50/50 split of the gross income.  
\- Optional test where students demonstrate their skill for a certificate.  
  
Interested? We will launch the Trainer submission form later this month! If you have questions, drop us a line at info@defcon.org.
