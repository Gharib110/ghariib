Expect your productivity to take another major hit courtesy of DEF CON 31. The music from Thursday and Friday is live on the [Media Server](https://media.defcon.org/DEF CON 31/)! Help yourself to selections from the amazing musicians we hosted. But that’s not all - we’ve got video for those shows, too! Download now and you’ll also get the beautiful wall animation that everyone’s talking about. You get all this for the low, low price of we love you. Enjoy, shake your groove thing and pass it on.
