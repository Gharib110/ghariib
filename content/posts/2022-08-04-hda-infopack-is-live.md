Many thanks to @A\_P\_Delchi for the [DEF CON 30 HDA Infopack](https://forum.defcon.org/node/242953)! This helpful guide for Hackers with Disabilities has venue maps, tips for traveling between venues and a concise explanation of DEF CON's HDA provisions. Let's look out for each other, and if you see a way we can improve our accessibility, let us know!
