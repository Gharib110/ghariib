AltspaceVR is getting sunsetted, so the DEF CON Groups Virtual Reality Team is throwing an 'End of the World' event on the platform March 3 at 7pm PST. You don't need a headset to come through, meet hackers from all over the world and just have a quality virtual hangout.  
  
Follow DCGVR on Twitter or [DCGVR.org](https://DCGVR.org) for info. They'll be announcing what VR platform they're moving to in the coming weeks.
