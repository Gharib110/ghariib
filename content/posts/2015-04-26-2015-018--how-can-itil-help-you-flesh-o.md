# 2015-018- How can ITIL help you flesh out your infosec program

<br/>

<br/>
When you're faced with major projects, or working to understand why your IDS fails every day at the same time, there must be a way to work that out. Or when you must do the yearly business continuity failover, you need a process oriented framework to track and ensure changes are committed in a sane, orderly manner.

ITIL is a completely versatile, flexible framework that scales with your organization. You can also use it with your software development lifecycle. You can use it to enhance major projects and security initiatives.

Tim Wood joins us for the second part of his interview. We discuss Change Management, Problem Management and making inter-departmental SLAs a reality for proper management of changes.
