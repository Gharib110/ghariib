# Notes from OARC44

<br/>

<br/>
The DNS Operations, Analysis, and Research Center (DNS-OARC) brings together DNS service operators, DNS software implementors, and researchers together to share concerns, information and learn together about the operation and evolution of the DNS. They meet between two or three times a year in a workshops format. The most recent workshop was held in Atlanta, in February 2025. Here are my thoughts on some of the material that was presented and discussed at this workshop where too much DNS is barely enough!
