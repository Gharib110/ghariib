We’re just month into 2023 and we’ve got a whole lot of new open calls for everyone. Starting today the [calls for Papers](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfp.html), [Demo Labs](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfdl.html), [Workshops](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfw.html), and [Vendors](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-vendor-app.html) are open for business. This means two things: more ways for you to participate in making DEF CON 31 amazing, and DEF CON is officially on the horizon. Welcome to DEF CON Season!  
  
Let’s DO this thing, people.
