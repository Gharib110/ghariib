Thanks to the fine folks at Nautilus Institute the DEF CON 32 CTF quals are in the books - you can read all about it at [https://quals.2024.nautilus.institute/](https://quals.2024.nautilus.institute/). There's also a veritable feast of JSON dumps for the curious. Congrats to the winners, thank you to everyone who suited up and we'll see you in Las Vegas!
