# 2016-031DFIR rebuttal and handling incident response

<br/>

<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, we discussed on our show that not all incident response events required digital forensics.  We got quite a bit of feedback about that episode, so in an effort to address the feedback, we brought Brian Ventura on.

Brian has 20+ years in Information Technology, ranging from systems administration to project management and information security. He is an Information Security Architect in Portland, Oregon and volunteers as the Director of Education for the Portland ISSA Chapter. Brian holds his CISSP and GCCC, as well as other industry certifications. As the Director of Education, Brian coordinates relevant local and online training opportunities.

We discuss definitions of what digital forensics are, and how that term really has a broad range for classification.

Brian will be teaching SEC566 in Long Beach in September. Here is the link for more information to sign up for this course...  [https://www.sans.org/community/event/sec566-long-beach-26sep2016-brian-ventura](https://www.sans.org/community/event/sec566-long-beach-26sep2016-brian-ventura)
