Today’s Signal release for Android and iOS includes beta support for video calls.

This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well. We think it’s a big improvement, but we’re rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it’s enabled for everyone by default.

To help us test on Android and iOS, toggle Signal Settings -> Advanced -> Video calling beta.

Only calls between Signal users who have _both_ enabled the video calling beta will use the new calling system.
