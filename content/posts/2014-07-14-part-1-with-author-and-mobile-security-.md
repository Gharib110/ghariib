# Part 1 with Author and Mobile Security Researcher Georgia Weidman

<br/>

<br/>
We have a real treat the next two weeks.  Author and Mobile Security Researcher Georgia Weidman, who we also found out will be providing exploit development training at Black Hat this year.

She is the author of an awesome book "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking" ([http://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands-On-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405304124&sr=8-1&keywords=georgia+weidman](http://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands-On-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405304124&sr=8-1&keywords=georgia+weidman))

She sat down with us over Skype and gave a nice talk about where she came from,  and why she wrote the book, and even what she's about to do in the future (that's next week) ;) You'll have to listen next week to find out the awesome trip she's about to take.
