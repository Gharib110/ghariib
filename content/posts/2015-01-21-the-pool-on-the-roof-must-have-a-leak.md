# The pool on the roof must have a leak

<br/>

<br/>
_Winter Break Of Code Day 9_

Today we hiked the Kalalau Trail and swam beneath the cold spray of a waterfall.

Today we discussed the finer points of the axolotl protocol used by TextSecure.

Today we delighted in “shave ice”, a local delicacy that is definitely _not_ a snow cone.

Today we wrote copy, polished features, closed bugs, and merged pull requests.

Measured by lines of code, today was short. Measured by steps taken, it was tall. Measured by ideas discussed, things learned, and sights seen, it was towering.
