GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is weighing on the minds and pocketbooks of a lot of European companies, but is the US as worried? If you read many of the news articles out there, it ranges from 'meh' to 'OMG, the sky, it is falling". GDPR will cause a lot of new issues in the way business is being done, not just in the realm of security, but in the way data is managed, maintained, catalogued, and shared.

This week we invited Ms. Wendy Everette Knox (@wendyck) to come in and discuss some of the issues that might hit companies. We also discuss how GDPR and the exit (or not) of the UK from the #European #Union will affect data holders and citizens of the UK.

If your company is preparing for the #GDPR mandate, check out the show notes for a lot of good info.

ALSO, If you are looking for a ticket to #derbycon 2017, you need to listen to this show, because it has all the info you need to get started.  The info is also in the show notes, including the form you need to post your flag information.

\---Show Notes:----

The **General Data Protection Regulation** (**GDPR**) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_\(European_Union\)) by which the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament), the [Council of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union) and the [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission) intend to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) (EU). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU. The primary objectives of the GDPR are to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#cite_note-1)

Would it be better if companies stored less data, or de-anon it to the point where a breach

Massive fines for breaches. Usually some percentage of profits…

(up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 Million (whichever is greater))

“Under the GDPR, the Data Controller will be under a legal obligation to notify the Supervisory Authority without undue delay. The reporting of a [data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach) is not subject to any _de minimis_ standard and must be reported to the Supervisory Authority within 72 hours of the data breach (Article 33).”

**Is 72 hours for notification realistic? For massive breaches, 72 hours is just enough time to contain**

Right to be forgotten (not realistic):

“A [_right to be forgotten_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) was replaced by a more limited _right to erasure_ in the version of the GDPR adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#cite_note-1_Essex_Court-19)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#cite_note-20) Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data “
