# Synlapse

<br/>

<br/>
Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Data Factory were vulnerable to cross-tenant access and code execution. This was made possible via a combination of (1) a shell injection RCE vulnerability in the integration runtime, (2) credentials for multiple customers stored on a shared host and (3) an insecure management server API.
