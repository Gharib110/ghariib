# Workshops Page is Live

<br/>

Workshops are back for DEF CON 29! We’ve got a wide variety of topics from a great roster of presenters, all of which you can peruse at your leisure on the [Workshops page](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-workshops.html).  
  
If you find a workshop that you want in on, you can sign up starting at 0900 PDT on Tuesday July 6. Seats generally fill quickly, so consider some pre-game finger stretches and warming up your mouse with some light gaming.  
  
It’s July, people. We’re in the home stretch!
