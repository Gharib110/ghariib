<p>We&rsquo;re heading back to London! And making a trip to Reykjavik. And Dublin. I talked about us considering this in the video yesterday, and just before publishing this post, we pulled the trigger and booked the tickets. The plan is to pretty much repeat the US and Canada trip we did in September and spend the time meeting up with some of the law enforcement agencies and various other organisations we&rsquo;ve been working with over the years. As I say in the video, if you&rsquo;re in one of these locations and are in a position to stand up a meetup or user group session, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. Europe is a hell of a long way to go so we do want to make the most of the travel, stand by for more plans as they emerge.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Every click, swipe, or pause we make online is tracked, often through pixel tracking. This tracking is used by advertisers, big tech, and even political groups to monitor your email activity (often without you knowing). Also referred to as web beacons or tracking pixels, these embedded spies collect your personal data: such as your device type, your location, and interaction behavior with the email. Let’s take an in-depth look at what tracking pixels are, why they’re used, how to spot email trackers, and lastly how you can stop pixel tracking by using email providers with automatic tracking protection like Tuta Mail.</p>

	<b><time>25.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>I am working on a AI model that have a few files larger than 10MiB of trained model. While pushing those models to huggingface repository I got an error saying the files are too large to upload. Hugging Face has a size limit for single files, and files larger than 10MiB need special handling. This means I need to change the way I upload or store these files.</p>
<p>This article will help you understand why this error happens and how you can fix it. You will learn how to push large files to a Hugging Face repository step by step.</p>

<p>For a long time, LLMs were very linear. When given a prompt, they provided an answer. There is no meta-logic involved, or any stage where the model might be able to self-correct if it is mistaken. This effectively hinders their ability to reason, question, or adjust to problems that may be inherent to the instruction they are responding to. For example, with low-reasoning models, complex language based mathematics problems may be too complicated to solve without explicit instructions and work on the users part.</p>

<p>Buckle up, folks, because this week’s episode is a wild ride through the Cavity of Lies—where HIPAA violations, ransomware attacks, and outright absurdity collide. What happens when a dental group tries to sweep a massive breach under the rug (or, you know, hide servers in bathrooms)? Let’s just say it doesn’t end well. From a […]</p>

<p>A bare-metal hypervisor, also known as a Type 1 hypervisor, is a virtualization software installed directly on computing hardware, controlling both the hardware and one or more guest operating systems (guest OSes).</p>
<p>This technology has significantly contributed to the transformation of IT infrastructure through efficient resource utilization and scalability, as detailed in our article on the <a href="/resources/articles/benefits-of-virtualization#what-is-virtualization">benefits of virtualization</a>. By directly interacting with hardware, bare metal hypervisors enhance performance and security, making them a crucial tool for enterprise IT infrastructure.</p>
