Weâ€™ve sold out of badges for online-only attendees. The Human Plus role on the DEF CON Discord ([discord.gg/defcon](https://discord.gg/defcon)) will be available to purchase soon on the server itself. In the meantime, remember to log in to the Discord to get familiar with the layout and say hi to everyone in the #LineCon channel!
