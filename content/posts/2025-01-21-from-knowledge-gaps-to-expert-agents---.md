# From Knowledge Gaps to Expert Agents - Unlocking the Advanced Use Cases of RAG with the DigitalOcean GenAI Platform

<br/>

<br/>
Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the way developers build and deploy applications. With tools like [DigitalOcean’s GenAI Platform](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/getting-started/quickstart/), you can go beyond basic AI capabilities and design powerful, tailored AI systems that cater to your exact needs. In this blog post, we will dive into two advanced features of the GenAI platform: Function Calling and Routing Multiple Agents. We’ll explore how these features can transform your AI workflows and open new possibilities for building intelligent applications.

[Function Calling: Customizing Your Agent and Expanding Capabilities](#function-calling-customizing-your-agent-and-expanding-capabilities)[](#function-calling-customizing-your-agent-and-expanding-capabilities)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most underrated features of LLM or RAG systems is [Function Calling](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/how-to/manage-ai-agent/route-functions/); it’s the mechanism by which the capabilities can be extended without retraining. Let’s look at some of the more critical reasons why utilizing Function Calling should be at the top of your list.

### [Customizing Your Entire Agent](#customizing-your-entire-agent)[](#customizing-your-entire-agent)

Utilizing [Function Calling](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/how-to/manage-ai-agent/route-functions/) with the GenAI platform allows you to unlock the full potential of your AI Agent by integrating external systems directly into its workflow. Whether you want your Agent to access another large language model (LLM), run a custom machine learning (ML) model, or call an external API, Function Calling makes it possible. This flexibility means you can tailor your AI Agent to handle tasks that align with your application’s needs, creating an entirely bespoke experience for your users.

### [Forking Into New Areas Beyond RAG Training](#forking-into-new-areas-beyond-rag-training)[](#forking-into-new-areas-beyond-rag-training)

One of the standout benefits of Function Calling is its ability to bridge gaps in your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent’s knowledge. Imagine your travel booking Agent is trained to handle hotel and car reservations but suddenly receives a query about foreign exchange rates. By invoking a function, your Agent can seamlessly call an external currency exchange API or switch to a specialized ML model for currency conversions. This specificity helps your Agent to handle diverse tasks without requiring extensive retraining, making it a robust solution for dynamic use cases.

### [Dynamic Real-Time Adaptation](#dynamic-real-time-adaptation)[](#dynamic-real-time-adaptation)

Your Agent can use Function Calling to adapt dynamically to user needs in real time. For example, a travel booking Agent could access live flight APIs to check prices, availability, or delays, helping users to get the most up-to-date information. This adaptability may be critical for time-sensitive applications like e-commerce, logistics, or news aggregation.

[Routing Multiple Agents: Building Specialized and Scalable Systems](#routing-multiple-agents-building-specialized-and-scalable-systems)[](#routing-multiple-agents-building-specialized-and-scalable-systems)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [GenAI Platforms’s Agent Routing](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/how-to/manage-ai-agent/route-agents/) feature enables modular design by creating Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) specific to a domain, industry, or problem. These SMEs can be reused throughout your workflows, pipelines, and system automation. Let’s uncover some of these use cases.

![Subject Matter Experts](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/SME.png)

### [Subject Matter Expertise Through Multiple Agents](#subject-matter-expertise-through-multiple-agents)[](#subject-matter-expertise-through-multiple-agents)

Routing Multiple Agents allows you to create a network of specialized AI Agents, each acting as a subject matter expert in its domain. For instance, you could have one Agent focused on billing support, another on customer support, and a third on supply chain management. This setup helps ensure that every query or task is routed to the most qualified Agent, delivering more accurate and efficient results. With specialized Agents, your AI system can become more precise and reliable.

### [Hierarchical Agent Structures](#hierarchical-agent-structures)[](#hierarchical-agent-structures)

You can take this approach further by organizing your Agents into a hierarchical structure. At the top level, a “router” Agent handles incoming queries and determines which specialized Agent should take over. This architecture simplifies the user’s experience by presenting a single entry point while maintaining the power of multiple specialized Agents behind the scenes. It’s a scalable solution that grows with your application’s complexity.

### [Multi-Language Support Through Dedicated Agents](#multi-language-support-through-dedicated-agents)[](#multi-language-support-through-dedicated-agents)

By routing queries to language-specific Agents, you can offer seamless multi-language support. For example, a top-level Agent could identify the user’s language and route the request to a Spanish-speaking customer support Agent or a German-speaking technical support Agent, each explicitly trained for their domain and language.

[Function Calling and Routing Harmony](#function-calling-and-routing-harmony)[](#function-calling-and-routing-harmony)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s explore the higher-level AI consciousness we can achieve when combining [Function Calling](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/how-to/manage-ai-agent/route-functions/) and [Agent Routing](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/genai-platform/how-to/manage-ai-agent/route-agents/) features.

### [Cross-Industry Application](#cross-industry-application)[](#cross-industry-application)

Function Calling and Routing Multiple Agents can work together to create cross-industry solutions. For example, in fraud prevention, a router Agent could classify user queries into identity verification, transaction monitoring, or anomaly detection. Each specialized Agent could then use Function Calling to interact with APIs for real-time risk assessment, external identity validation services, or ML models designed to flag suspicious patterns. This can help provide a streamlined and effective approach to fraud prevention.

### [Complex Data Analysis Pipelines](#complex-data-analysis-pipelines)[](#complex-data-analysis-pipelines)

In fraud prevention, Function Calling can integrate specialized data analysis tools while the router Agent manages the overall pipeline. For instance, the router Agent could divide tasks among Agents specializing in transaction analysis, user behavior tracking, and compliance reporting. These specialized Agents can use Function Calling to access external fraud detection APIs, advanced ML models, or compliance validation tools, creating a more accurate and efficient pipeline to help you mitigate fraudulent activities.

### [Personalized Recommendations Through Specialized Agents](#personalized-recommendations-through-specialized-agents)[](#personalized-recommendations-through-specialized-agents)

In recommendation systems, routing multiple Agents can offer hyper-personalized suggestions. A router Agent could identify the user’s preferences and route queries to Agents trained on specific datasets (e.g., movies, books, or products). Each Agent specializes in a domain but works in concert to deliver tailored results.
