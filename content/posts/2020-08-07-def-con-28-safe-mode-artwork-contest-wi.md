# DEF CON 28 SAFE MODE Artwork Contest Winners

<br/>

<br/>
We want to offer our heartfelt thanks to everyone who entered the DEF CON Safe Mode Art Contest. We’re always amazed at the level of talent in this community.  
  
This year’s runner up is a stylish meditation on the profusion of connectivities that characterize modern life by Rita Tu.

Much like Highlanders, however, in the end there can be only one. This year’s highlander is @hannahdiazart. The entry has both wide-eyed discovery (very on theme) and boxes full of random electronics (super relatable). Also a robot dinosaur. It communicates something about the hacker spirit that is both warm and life-affirming.

Congratulations to Hannah and Rita and thanks again to everyone who participated.
