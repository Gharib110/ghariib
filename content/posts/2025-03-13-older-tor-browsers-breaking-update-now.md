# Older Tor Browsers Breaking Update Now

<br/>

<br/>
  ![](https://blog.torproject.org/old-tor-browsers-breakage/lead.png)

The expiration, happening on March 14 2025, of a [root certificate used by Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/root-certificate-expiration) for add-ons verification on Firefox 115.12 and below, can suddenly disable extensions, including the built-in [NoScript](https://noscript.net), and cause functionality such as the Security Slider to break on Tor Browser versions older than 13.5.11 legacy.

We hope the vast majority of Tor Browser users are already up-to-date with the latest available version for their OS, currently 14.0.7 stable or 13.5.13 legacy, which also provide the newest security fixes.

The few who are not yet, should update immediately from the [Tor Browser download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in order to prevent the aforementioned functionality breakage and other security risks.
