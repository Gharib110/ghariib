# Join Python List Techniques Examples and Best Practices

<br/>

<br/>
### [Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)

In Python, joining a list of strings involves concatenating the elements of the list into a single string, using a specified delimiter to separate each element. This operation is particularly useful when you need to convert a list of strings into a single string, such as when you want to save a list of alphabets as a comma-separated string in a file.

In this tutorial, you will learn the various techniques for [concatenating lists](/community/tutorials/concatenate-lists-python) and [strings](/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation) in Python. It covers the use of the `join()` method to merge a list of strings into a single string, the concatenation of two lists using the `+` operator or `itertools.chain()`, and the combination of a list with a set. Additionally, you will also learn using the `strip()` method for removing leading and trailing whitespace from a string.

[Python Join List](#python-join-list)[](#python-join-list)
----------------------------------------------------------

We can use the [python string](/community/tutorials/python-string) `join()` function to join a list of strings. This function takes `iterable` as argument and List is an iterable, so we can use it with List. Also, the list should contain strings, if you will try to join a list of `ints` then you will get an error message as `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found`. Let’s look at a short example for joining list in python to create a string.

To resolve the error when trying to join a list of `ints`, you can convert each element to a string before joining. Here’s an example:

```
int_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Convert each element to string before joining
int_list_str = [str(element) for element in int_list]
joined_str = ",".join(int_list_str)
print("Joined string:", joined_str)
# Output: Joined string: 1,2,3,4,5
```

```
vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]

vowelsCSV = ",".join(vowels)

print("Vowels are = ", vowelsCSV)
```

When we run the above program, it will produce the following output.

```
Vowels are =  a,e,i,o,u
```

### [Python join two strings](#python-join-two-strings)[](#python-join-two-strings)

We can use join() function to join two strings too.

```
message = "Hello ".join("World")

print(message) #prints 'Hello World'
```

### [Why `join()` function is in String and not in List?](#why-join-function-is-in-string-and-not-in-list)[](#why-join-function-is-in-string-and-not-in-list)

One question arises with many python developers is why the join() function is part of String and not list. Wouldn’t below syntax be more easy to remember and use?

```
vowelsCSV = vowels.join(",")
```

There is a popular [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/493819/python-join-why-is-it-string-joinlist-instead-of-list-joinstring) around this, here I am listing the most important points from the discussions that makes total sense to me.

The main reason is that [join() function](/community/tutorials/python-join-list) can be used with any [iterable](/community/tutorials/python-iterator) and result is always a String, so it makes sense to have this function in String API rather than having it in all the iterable classes.

### [Joining list of multiple data-types](#joining-list-of-multiple-data-types)[](#joining-list-of-multiple-data-types)

Let’s look at a program where we will try to join list items having multiple data types.

```
names = ['Java', 'Python', 1]
delimiter = ','
single_str = delimiter.join(names)
print('String: {0}'.format(single_str))
```

Let’s see the output for this program: ![python join list multiple data types](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/03/python-join-list-multiple-datatypes.png) This was just a demonstration that a list which contains **multiple data-types cannot be combined into a single String with `join()` function**. **List must contain only the String values**.

### [Split String using the `join()` function](#split-string-using-the-join-function)[](#split-string-using-the-join-function)

We can use `join()` function to split a string with specified delimiter too.

```
names = 'Python'
delimiter = ','
single_str = delimiter.join(names)
print('String: {0}'.format(single_str))
```

![python split string using join function](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/03/python-split-string.png) This shows that when String is passed as an argument to join() function, it splits it by character and with the specified delimiter.

### [Using split() function](#using-split-function)[](#using-split-function)

Apart from splitting with the `join()` function, `split()` function can be used to split a String as well which works almost the same way as the `join()` function. Let’s look at a code snippet:

```
names = ['Java', 'Python', 'Go']
delimiter = ','
single_str = delimiter.join(names)
print('String: {0}'.format(single_str))

split = single_str.split(delimiter)
print('List: {0}'.format(split))
```

Let’s see the output for this program: ![python split function, split string in python](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/03/python-split-string-function.png) We used the same delimiter to split the String again to back to the original list.

### [Splitting only `n` times](#splitting-only-n-times)[](#splitting-only-n-times)

The `split()` function we demonstrated in the last example also takes an optional second argument which signifies the number of times the splot operation should be performed. Here is a sample program to demonstrate its usage:

```
names = ['Java', 'Python', 'Go']
delimiter = ','
single_str = delimiter.join(names)
print('String: {0}'.format(single_str))

split = single_str.split(delimiter, 1)
print('List: {0}'.format(split))
```

Let’s see the output for this program: ![python split count](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/03/python-split-count.png) This time, split operation was performed only one time as we provided in the `split()` function parameter. That’s all for joining a list to create a string in python and using split() function to get the original list again.

[Performance Comparison between `join()`, `+` Operator, and `itertools.chain()`](#performance-comparison-between-join-operator-and-itertools-chain)[](#performance-comparison-between-join-operator-and-itertools-chain)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When combining lists or strings in Python, it’s essential to understand the performance implications of different methods. Here’s a comparison of `join()`, `+` Operator, and `itertools.chain()`:

For example:

```
# Using join()
strings = ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']
joined_string = ','.join(strings)
print(joined_string)  # Output: Hello,World,Python

# Using + Operator
strings = ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']
concatenated_string = 'Hello' + ',' + 'World' + ',' + 'Python'
print(concatenated_string)  # Output: Hello,World,Python

# Using itertools.chain()
from itertools import chain
strings = ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']
chained_strings = list(chain(*strings))
print(','.join(chained_strings))  # Output: Hello,World,Python
```

[Some Practical Use Cases](#some-practical-use-cases)[](#some-practical-use-cases)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Using `join()` for Strings**: When you have a list of strings and need a single concatenated string with delimiters, `join()` is the preferred method. This is particularly useful when you need to format a string with multiple parts, such as creating a sentence from a list of words or combining a list of names with commas.

```
words = ['Python', 'is', 'awesome']
sentence = ' '.join(words)
print(sentence)  # Output: Python is awesome
```

-   **Combining Lists with `itertools.chain()`:** For merging multiple lists, especially large ones, `itertools.chain()` offers a memory-efficient solution. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or when you need to process elements from multiple lists in a single iteration. By using `itertools.chain()`, you can avoid creating intermediate lists, which can significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance.

```
import itertools

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined = list(itertools.chain(list1, list2))
print(combined)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

[Combining Lists with Dictionaries or Sets](#combining-lists-with-dictionaries-or-sets)[](#combining-lists-with-dictionaries-or-sets)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When working with lists, dictionaries, and sets in Python, it’s essential to understand how to combine them effectively. Lists are ordered sequences of elements, while dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, and sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Combining these data structures requires careful consideration of their characteristics and the desired outcome.

-   **Lists and Dictionaries:** To combine a list with a dictionary, you might want to extract the dictionary’s keys or values and then concatenate them with the list. This can be useful when you need to merge data from different sources or formats. Here’s an example of how you can do this:

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {'a': 4, 'b': 5}

# Combining list with dictionary keys
combined_keys = my_list + list(my_dict.keys())
print(combined_keys)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b']

# Combining list with dictionary values
combined_values = my_list + list(my_dict.values())
print(combined_values)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In the above code, we first define a list `my_list` and a dictionary `my_dict`. Then, we use the `list()` function to convert the dictionary’s keys or values into a list, which can be concatenated with `my_list` using the `+` operator. The resulting combined list is then printed to the console.

-   **Lists and Sets:** Since sets are unordered collections of unique elements, you can convert a set to a list before combining it with another list. This is particularly useful when you need to merge data from different sources or formats, ensuring that all elements are unique. Here’s an example of how you can combine a list with a set:

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_set = {4, 5, 6}

# Combining list with set
combined = my_list + list(my_set)
print(combined)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In this example, we define a list `my_list` and a set `my_set`. We then convert the set to a list using the `list()` function and concatenate it with `my_list` using the `+` operator. The resulting combined list is then printed to the console. Note that the order of elements in the set is not preserved due to its unordered nature.
