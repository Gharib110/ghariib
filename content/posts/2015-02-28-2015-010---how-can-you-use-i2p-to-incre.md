# 2015-010 - How can you use I2P to increase your security and anonymity

<br/>

<br/>
Mr. Boettcher got a hold of the developers and maintainers of the anonymizing network "I2P". We talked with "str4d" and "Jeff" this week.

In Part 1 of the interview, we discuss the technical aspects of I2P, how it functions, how 'Garlic routing' works, and how the flood Fill servers allow for I2P to function effectively.

In the final segment, we discuss form factors, specifically if I2P is available for embedded systems like Raspberry Pi.

If you find Tor not to your liking, give I2P a try... it's goals are the same, but the method of security and privacy are different. Plus, as you can hear from the podcast, it's very much a tight knit community of security and privacy enthusiasts.
