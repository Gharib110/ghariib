The moment has arrived! You can reserve your badge for DEF CON in Vegas or the DEF CON online-only event right now at [shop.defcon.org](https://shop.defcon.org). Your pre-purchase allows us to accurately predict attendance, and it guarantees you a physical badge and secures your space if the venue is forced to restrict capacity. We thank you for your support and flexibility – hard numbers are the only way we can responsibly make a physical DEF CON happen this year.  
  
Cash at the door will still be honored for as long as spaces last, but there is a chance we’ll have to turn away cash customers if we reach capacity for our venues.  
  
For everyone who can’t be with us in person, the Safe Mode option continues over on Discord and we expect to start mailing out badges in early July.  
  
We’ve got an [FAQ page for all of your questions](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-faq.html), and you can always get in touch with us at info@defcon.org. Thank you again for the support - we can’t wait for August 5!
