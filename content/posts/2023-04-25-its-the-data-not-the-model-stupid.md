# Its the Data Not the Model Stupid

<br/>

<br/>
The latest episode of The Cyberlaw Podcast was not created by chatbots (we swear!). Guest host Brian Fleming, along with guests [Jay Healey](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/communities-connections/faculty/jason-healey), [Maury Shenk](https://www.steptoe.com/en/lawyers/maury-shenk.html), and [Nick Weaver](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/), discuss the latest news on the AI revolution including [Google’s efforts](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/technology/google-search-engine-ai.html?utm_source=pocket_saves) to protect its search engine dominance, a fascinating look at the [websites that feed tools like ChatGPT](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-chatbot-learning/) (leading some on the panel to argue that quality over quantity should be goal), and [a possible regulatory speed bump for total AI world domination](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/19/1071789/openais-hunger-for-data-is-coming-back-to-bite-it/?utm_source=pocket_saves), at least as far as the EU’s General Data Privacy Regulation is concerned. Next, Jay lends some perspective on where we’ve been and where we’re going with respect to cybersecurity by reflecting on some notable recent and upcoming anniversaries. The panel then discusses recent charges brought by the Justice Department, and two arrests, aimed at [China’s alleged attempt to harass dissidents living in the U.S.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-security-unit-targeted-u-s-with-fake-social-media-scheme-prosecutors-allege-527b6528?mod=djemalertNEWS&utm_source=pocket_saves) (including with fake social media accounts) and ponders how much of Russia’s playbook China is willing to adopt. Nick and Brian then discuss the [Securities and Exchange Commission’s complaint against Bittrex](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/17/crypto-exchange-bittrex-violated-federal-laws-sec-charges-in-lawsuit/?utm_source=pocket_saves) and what it could portend for others in the crypto space and, more broadly, the future of crypto regulation and enforcement in the U.S. Maury then discusses the [new EU-wide crypto regulations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-20/eu-s-mica-crypto-regulations-clear-final-parliament-vote?leadSource=uverify%20wall), and what the EU’s approach to regulating this industry could mean going forward. The panel then takes a hard look at an [alarming story out of Taiwan](https://thediplomat.com/2023/04/after-chinese-vessels-cut-matsu-internet-cables-taiwan-shows-its-communications-resilience/?utm_source=pocket_saves) and debates what the recent “invisible blockade” on Matsu means for China’s future designs on the island and Taiwan’s ability to bolster the resiliency of its communications infrastructure. Finally, Nick covers a recent report on the [Mexican government’s continued reliance on Pegasus spyware](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/world/americas/pegasus-spyware-mexico.html?utm_source=pocket_saves). To wrap things up in the week’s quick hits, Jay proposes [updating the Insurrection Act](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/09/could-trump-deploy-us-cyber-command-against-protestors/168342/) to avoid its use as a justification for deploying military cyber capabilities against U.S. citizens, Nick discusses the dangers of [computer generated swatting services](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7z8be/torswats-computer-generated-ai-voice-swatting?utm_source=pocket_saves), Brian highlights the [recent Supreme Court argument](https://www.fastcompany.com/90881970/supreme-court-to-decide-when-social-media-stalking-illegal) that may settle whether online stalking is a “true threat” v. protected First Amendment activity, and, last but not least, Nick checks in on [Elon Musk’s threat to sue Microsoft](https://www.pcmag.com/news/elon-musk-threatens-to-sue-microsoft-after-it-drops-twitter-from-ad-platform?utm_source=pocket_saves) after Twitter is dropped from its ad platform.
