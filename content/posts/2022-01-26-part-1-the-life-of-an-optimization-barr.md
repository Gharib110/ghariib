# Part 1 The life of an optimization barrier

<br/>

<br/>
Many engineers choose Rust as their language of choice for implementing cryptographic protocols because of its robust security guarantees. Although Rust makes safe cryptographic engineering easier, there are still some challenges to be aware of. Among them is the need to preserve constant-time properties, which ensure that, regardless of the input, code \[â€¦\]
