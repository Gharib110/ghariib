# Destroying x86_64 instruction decoders with differential fuzzing

<br/>

<br/>
TL;DR: x86\_64 decoding is hard, and the number and variety of implementations available for it makes it uniquely suited to differential fuzzing. We’re open sourcing mishegos, a differential fuzzer for instruction decoders. You can use it to discover discrepancies in your own decoders and analysis tools! In the beginning, there was instruction decoding Decompilation and \[…\]
