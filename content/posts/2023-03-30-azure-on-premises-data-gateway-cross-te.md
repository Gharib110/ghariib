# Azure on-premises data gateway cross-tenant access

<br/>

<br/>
Azure on-premises data gateway allows data transfer between an on-prem customer network and several Azure cloud services, and also enables a connected agent installed locally in an on-prem network to perform certain actions remotely. NetSPI discovered a deserialization issue in Microsoft Power Platform connectors that lead to RCE on several Azure backend servers that processed call backs from on-premises data gateways, effectively allowing unauthorized cross-tenant access.
