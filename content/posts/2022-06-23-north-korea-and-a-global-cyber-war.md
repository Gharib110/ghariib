# North Korea and a global cyber war

<br/>

<br/>
Carole Theriault interviews author and journalist Geoff White on his upcoming book, "The Lazarus Heist: From Hollywood to High Finance: Inside North Korea's Global Cyber War." Joe and Dave share some listener follow up from listener John, regarding a T-mobile breach and how he was notified through a third-party monitoring service and not T-Mobile. Joe's story shares how hackers are also keeping an eye on the upcoming holidays and describes how a Father's Day beer contest from Heineken was a scam. Dave's story is on police warning against a rise in voice phishing as they have made 2000 arrests since the crackdown on social engineering and business email scams started. Our catch of the day comes all the way from the Netherlands, listener Joram shares a scam he discovered in his spam folder. The sender notified him that she is frail and will be dying soon, to which her millions of dollars will be lost since she has no next of kin. The sender goes on to tell him that he is receiving this money just out of the goodness of her heart.
