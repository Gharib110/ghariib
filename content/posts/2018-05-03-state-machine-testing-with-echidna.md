# State Machine Testing with Echidna

<br/>

<br/>
Property-based testing is a powerful technique for verifying arbitrary properties of a program via execution on a large set of inputs, typically generated stochastically. Echidna is a library and executable I’ve been working on for applying property-based testing to EVM code (particularly code written in Solidity). Echidna is a library for generating random sequences of \[…\]
