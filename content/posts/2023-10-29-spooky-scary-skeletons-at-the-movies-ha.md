# Spooky scary skeletons at the movies Hacking humans goes to the movies

<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for joining us again for a very special and scary episode brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Hacking Humans co-host Dave Bittner is joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies and television shows with examples of the social engineering, scams, and schemes you hear Dave and co-host Joe Carrigan talk about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave and Rick watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then they deconstruct what they saw. Grab your bowl of popcorn and join us for some frightfully fantastic scams and frauds. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Dave's clip from the movie: Halloween III Rick's clip from the movie: Get Out
