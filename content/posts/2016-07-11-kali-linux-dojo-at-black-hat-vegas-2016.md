<br/>
The folks at **Black Hat** have been kind enough to invite us once again to deliver a [Kali Dojo in Las Vegas](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/kali-linux.html) this year. The event will be held on the **4th of August at the Mandalay Bay** hotel, and will be open to all Black Hat pass types. This year our Dojo will be set up differently, allowing for a larger crowd and much more interaction. We are going to hold a full day event, featuring several main activity areas :

Area 1: Customising Kali ISOs using live-build
----------------------------------------------

One to the most important aspects of Kali Linux is it ability to be customized based on your unique and specific needs. **Define your toolsets,** your desktop environment, customised scripts and wallpapers - and of course, **preseed your installation** media as needed. This area of the Dojo will feature the ever popular custom ISO generation on Kali Rolling.

Area 2: Kali Live USB with Persistence and LUKS
-----------------------------------------------

USB speeds keep getting faster and faster, to the point now where they are viable storage for a secondary system. In this area we will help you understand how to deploy your customized Kali ISO to a **secure, encrypted, USB install**. Complete with Kali specific features such as **multiple persistent stores and LUKS Nuke**!

Area 3: Hacking with Kali Linux - Test the tools
------------------------------------------------

Now that you have tweaked out and customized Kali install, what do you do with it? **Hack stuff**! In this area we will provide you with a safe and secure area to put Kali to use, with **real world attack vectors**. Get your hands dirty and hack our stuff! And did we mention **prizes**? Oh yeah, there will be prizes! Including give aways of **Kali NetHunter devices, Kali Flip laptops, and OffSec Penetration Testing with Kali Linux courses**!

Area 4: The wonderful world of Kali ARM devices
-----------------------------------------------

One of the most exciting developments in modern Linux is non-traditional computing devices. Kali has always been at the forefront of ARM support, and has aggressively added support for a wide range of unique and **specialized ARM devices**. In this area, you will get a chance to see and go hands-on with a number of these unique devices. Additionally, you will be provided the opportunity to interact directly with Kali Developers!

Come to the Dojo and say “Hi”
-----------------------------

We are **extremely excited** about this years Kali Dojo. This new format will facilitate more attendees (no more getting turned away at the door because we are full!) as well as more direct **one on one interaction with Kali Developers** and the OffSec team. If you have even a passing interest in Kali Linux, drop on in and say hi, hit us up with questions, and put Kali to use for a chance to win some awesome prizes!

Kali Linux 2016.2 Release
-------------------------

As we do every year, we will have some fresh pre-release Kali Linux 2016.2 ISOs fresh from the oven exclusively for our students, Dojo attendees and anyone else who wants to peek at our upcoming version of Kali Linux. Our final 2016.2 release will happen once we’re back from the conferences and fully recovered.
