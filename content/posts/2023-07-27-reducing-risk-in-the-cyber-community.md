# Reducing risk in the cyber community

<br/>

<br/>
Perry Carpenter joins Dave to discuss his book "The Security Culture Playbook: An Executive Guide To Reducing Risk and Developing Your Human Defense Layer." Joe and Dave share some listener follow up on messing with scammers, and how dangerous that actually can be. Joe's story follows hackers trying to steal your secrets using infected USB drives. Dave's story is on a tech executive and how they fell victim to a dating site scam, where the perpetrator was able to gain $450,000 from someone who just thought they found their soulmate. Our catch of the day this week comes from listener Ryan, who writes in sharing a renew license scam from New Zealand, with a carefully crafted email, made to look like the real thing.
