Dave shares the story of a malicious website posing as a Coronavirus map supposedly from Johns Hopkins University, Joe has the story of an elderly woman who lost a lot of money to two men claiming her grandson was in a car accident, the Catch of the Day's dying wish is to give you money to build an orphanage, and later in the show Carole Theriault returns and speaks with Samuel C. Woolley from University of Texas at Austin on disinformation campaigns. Links to stories: the Botometer The Catch of the Day: Been going back and forth with these a-holes for a few weeks now. More pictures in comments. Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share? Email it to us at hackinghumans@thecyberwire.com or hit us up on Twitter.
