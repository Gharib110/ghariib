Here’s an early Christmas present for all the DEF CON content creators out there. The [theme for DEF CON 31](https://defcon.org/images/defcon-31/dc31styleguide-wide.webp) is ‘The Future Will Prevail’. You can follow the link to get your colors, fonts and some inspiration. We’ll be following up with more homework as the weeks roll on. We can’t wait to see where you’ll take it.
