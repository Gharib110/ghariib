# Indian Government Breach Disclosure

<br/>

<br/>
Indian Government Breach, Disclosure Last month, Sakura Samurai announced that we had uncovered a massive amount of critical vulnerabilities. Obviously, to prevent threat actors from exploiting the vulnerabilities, we ensured that we redacted the specific issues and only gave a brief overview on what we had discovered. After working with the NSCS, we have been given the green-light to disclose more specific details and all 34-pages of our reported vulnerabilities have been adequately remediated.
