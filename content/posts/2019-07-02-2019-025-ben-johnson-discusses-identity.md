# 2019-025-Ben Johnson discusses identity rights management and controlling your AuthNAuthZ issues

<br/>

Identity analytics

“Identity analytics is the next evolution of the IGA (Identity Governance & Administration) market. Identity professionals can use this emerging set of solutions combining big data and advanced analytics to increase identity-related risk awareness and enhance IAM processes such as access certification, access request and role management.” --gartner

Identity related risk awareness

**Access certification** is the process of validating **access** rights within systems. ... With **access certification**, organizations and regulations aim to formally validate users within systems and ensure their **access** rights are appropriate.

Access request - a system must validate that a user has need-to-know

Role management - users must be validated in a particular role or roles (admin, superuser, backup controller, launch manager, code committer)

What kind of threats are you protecting against?

What do you solve that proper administration of users can do?

How does technology like this improve IAM processes? 

If it gathers heuristics, what happens when a user changes? (loses an arm, finger, or sneezes during password login, or just ages?)

Where is the best fit for these kinds of systems? 

Where should you put these systems if you’re in a blended environment? And how does this work with systems like Active Directory?

Privacy issues… what if any do you have to deal with in this case? 

That was my next question

Entitlements? What’s the difference between AuthN?

Does this monitor, or will it also prevent? 

If it doesn’t, can it send alerts to you IPS to isolate?
