‘Tis the season, hackerfolk. DEF CON is almost here and all four tracks of the main speaker schedule are live on the website! Visit the [Schedule page](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-schedule.html) to start your planning. Our valiant CFP Review Board has put together a strong list of presentations over a wide array of subjects. We’re sure you’ll find plenty of interest.  
  
Feel free to tweet at us about the talks you want to see, and feel equally to free to get hyped. Less than a month now, people.
