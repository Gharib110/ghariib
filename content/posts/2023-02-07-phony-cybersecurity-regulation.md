# Phony Cybersecurity Regulation

<br/>

<br/>
This episode of the Cyberlaw Podcast is dominated by stories about possible cybersecurity regulation. [David Kris](https://nationalsecurity.gmu.edu/david-kris/) points us first to [**an article**](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/stop-passing-buck-cybersecurity) by the leadership of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Administration in Foreign Affairs. Jen Easterly and Eric Goldstein seem to take a tough line on “Why Companies Must Build Safety Into Tech Products.“ But for all the tough language, one word, “regulation,” is entirely missing from the piece. Meanwhile, the cybersecurity strategy that the White House has been reportedly drafting for months seems to be [**hung up over how enthusiastically to demand regulation**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/05/biden-cyber-strategy-hacking/).

All of which seems just a little weird in a world where Republicans hold the House. Regulation is not likely to be high on the GOP to-do list, so calls for tougher regulation are almost certainly more symbolic than real.

Still, this is a week for symbolic calls for regulation. David also takes us through an [**National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) report**](https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/mobileappecosystemreport.pdf?_ga=2.261769796.836302739.1675604152-535980808.1670591707) on the anticompetitive impact of Apple’s and Google’s control of their mobile app markets. The report points to [**many problems and opportunities for abuse inherent in their headlock**](https://www.axios.com/2023/02/01/biden-admin-report-criticizes-apple-google-app-stores) on what apps can be sold to phone users. But, as Google and Apple are quick to point out, they do play a role in regulating app security, so breaking the headlock could be bad for cybersecurity. In any event, practically every recommendation for action in the report is a call for Congress to step in—almost certainly a nonstarter for reasons already given.

Not to be outdone on the phony regulation beat, [Jordan Schneider](https://rhg.com/) and [Sultan Meghji](https://carnegieendowment.org/experts/1778) explore some of the policy and regulatory proposals for AI that have been inspired by the success of ChatGPT. The EU’s AI Act is coming in for lots of attention, [mainly from parts of the industry that want to be regulation-free](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/github-ceo-on-why-open-source-developers-should-be-exempt-from-the-eus-ai-act/?utm_source=pocket_reader). Sultan and I trade observations about who’ll be hollowed out first by ChatGPT, law firms or investment firms.

Sultan also tells us why [the ION ransomware hack](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/ion-removed-from-hacker-s-target-list-deadline-for-ransom-suspended#xj4y7vzkg) matters. Jordan and Sultan find a cybersecurity angle to [The Great Chinese Balloon Scandal](https://idstch.com/space/stratospheric-balloons-provide-high-speed-internet-military-wide-area-real-time-intelligence/) of 2023. And I offer an assessment of Matt Taibbi’s [story about the Hamilton 68 “Russian influence” reports](about:blank). If you have wondered what the fuss was about, do not expect mainstream media to tell you; the media does not come out looking good in this story. Unfortunately for Matt Taibbi, he does not look much better than the reporters his story criticizes. David thinks it is a balanced and moderate take, for which I offer an apology and a promise to do better next time.
