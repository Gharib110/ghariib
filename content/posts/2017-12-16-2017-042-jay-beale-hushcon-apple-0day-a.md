# 2017-042-Jay beale Hushcon Apple 0Day and BsidesWLG audio

<br/>

<br/>
Ms. Berlin and Mr. Boettcher are on holiday this week, and I (Bryan) went to Hushcon ([www.hushcon.com](http://www.hushcon.com)) last week (8-9 Dec 2017). Lots of excellent discussion and talks.

While there, our friend Jay Beale (@jaybeale) came on to discuss Hushcon, as well as some recent news. 

Google released an 0day for Apple iOS, and we talk about how jailbreaking repos seem to be shuttering, because there have not been as many as vulns found to allow for jailbreaking iDevices.

We also went back and discussed some highlights of the DFIR hierarchy show last week ([https://brakesec.com/2017-041](https://brakesec.com/2017-041)) and some of the real world examples of someone who has seen it on a regular basis. Jay's insights are something you shouldn't miss

Finally, Ms. Berlin went to New Zealand and gave a couple of talks at Bsides Wellington (@bsideswlg). She interviewed Chris Blunt ([https://twitter.com/chrisblunt](https://twitter.com/chrisblunt)) and "Olly the Ninja" ([https://twitter.com/Ollytheninja](https://twitter.com/Ollytheninja)) about what makes a good con.
