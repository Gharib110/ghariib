# No More Free Bugs Initiatives

<br/>

<br/>
[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TwllnzsiNsk/TlPlAiOzjhI/AAAAAAAACok/psNoWtVv0HY/s320/nomorefreebugs.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TwllnzsiNsk/TlPlAiOzjhI/AAAAAAAACok/psNoWtVv0HY/s1600/nomorefreebugs.png)Two years after the launch of the "[No More Free Bugs](http://trailofbits.com/2009/03/22/no-more-free-bugs/)" philosophy, several companies and Open Source projects are now offering programs designed to encourage security research in their products. In addition, many private firms are publicly offering vulnerability acquisition programs.  
  
  
This post is an attempt to catalog all public and active incentives. This includes traditional "Bug Bounty Programs" as well as "Vulnerability/Exploit Acquisition Programs".  
**Update (19 Oct 2013):** A new website [http://www.bugsheet.com/bug-bounties](http://www.bugsheet.com/bug-bounties) has started collecting bug bounties and disclosure programs. I do recognize that an actual website is better than a single blog post, thus I've discontinued this list.

Contributions are welcome! If you are aware of an initiative not listed here or you want to report an inaccuracy in your initiative, please leave a comment and we will update this page over time. In fact, the more people, the better.  
  
Just to clarify, we aim at indexing programs that are:  

-   Legal. Although black/gray market places exist, we don't certainly want to list them here
-   Active. We want to keep track of ongoing initiatives. Even time-limited programs are eligible, as long as they are still accepting submissions
-   Public. All entries must have publicly available details. This may range from accurate guidelines and rules to just a simple sentence stating the nature of the incentive. It hence follows that we are going to report public information only. In case of cash rewards, the actual amount is reported whenever the min-max price paid is clearly stated
-   Reward-based. In most cases, entries are "cash-for-bugs" programs. However, any kind of tangible reward is eligible. "No More Free Bugs" versus "No More Cheap Bugs" disputes are not considered here

**Disclaimer:** we do not endorse, represent or warrant the accuracy or reliability of any of these programs.
