Raj Ananthanpillai from Trua joins Dave to discuss privacy concerns and what you shouldn't share with ChatGPT. Dave and Joe share some listener follow up from Clayton who shares some comments on a previous episode where Dave discusses bomb threats to retail stores for ransom. Dave's story follows Google rapidly trying to correct bogus airline phone numbers that were discovered this week. Joe's story is on an Android app called "Spyhide" which is a phone surveillance app, that has been collecting private phone data from tens of thousands of Android devices around the world. Our catch of the day is from listener Isak who writes in to share a comedic spam email he received. Links to stories: Called a bogus airline customer support number? Google is hustling to fix that Spyhide stalkerware is spying on tens of thousands of phones Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
