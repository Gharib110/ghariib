		<p>In response to growing worries about the safety of children using Roblox, the CEO of the company has said to parents: ‚ÄúMy first message would be, if you‚Äôre not comfortable, don‚Äôt let your kids be on Roblox.‚Äù</p>
<p>Roblox is one of the most popular gaming platforms, especially among young children. Reportedly, of the over 80 million players per day, roughly 40% of them are below the age of 13.</p>
<p>As we wrote last month, a lawsuit was recently initiated against Roblox and messaging platform Discord, in which Roblox was referred to as a ‚Äúreal-life nightmare for children.‚Äù</p>

		<p>In‚ÄØ2020, Google introduced Core Web Vitals metrics to measure some aspects of real-world user experience on the web. This blog has consistently achieved good scores for two of these metrics: Largest Contentful Paint and Interaction to Next Paint. However, optimizing the third metric, Cumulative Layout Shift, which measures unexpected layout changes, has been more challenging. Let‚Äôs face it: optimizing for this metric is not really useful for a site like this one. But getting a better score is always a good distraction. üíØ</p>

<p>With the increasing adoption of mobile banking and payment apps, financial institutions face greater challenges in securing cardholder data. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) outlines stringent requirements to protect payment card data, ensuring that institutions maintain trust and security in their mobile ecosystems. Additionally, the European Payment Services Directives (PSD2 and the upcoming PSD3) introduce mandates like Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to further enhance security in electronic payments.</p>

		<p>In early 2024, we started a journey to implement better metrics for our internal Red Team. Our first iteration focused on what we now call the adoption rate metric, which measures how often the recommendations our team makes are accepted and implemented.</p>
<p>Choosing this metric was very deliberate. While there are many ways to measure a Red Team&rsquo;s impact, we wanted to start with something fundamental: Are we actually driving meaningful security improvements? The adoption rate directly ties our work to real security outcomes, and we could measure it using tools and processes we already had in place.</p>
