# DeepSec 2024 Opening Conference Days are now live

<br/>

<br/>
DeepSec 2024 has opened. Enjoy the two days of presentations, discussions, and insights into how to improve the security of your information technology infrastructure. Our keynote will deep dive into the dangerous world of mind manipulation. Social engineering is a threat from the past. Political engineering is the new kid on the block, and it has the power to reshape and destroy nation states and societies. Fake news, propaganda, and outright lies have become the standard tool of radical parties, be it left, right, or centre. Randahl Fink explores the power of the mind bomb in his keynote presentation. For everyone attending: Our only social media presence is in the Fediverse. Please use our @DeepSec handle and the #DeepSec hash tag for referencing content and discussions. Do not use Twitter/X or similar platforms. Thank
