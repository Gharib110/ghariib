The DEF CON 30 Call for Villages is already open! To see if your fave is already accepted, check out the [Villages forum for DEF CON 30](https://forum.defcon.org/node/239770)! Don't see what you want on the current list? Maybe that's your cue to [submit a proposal](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfv.html)!  
  
For the truly ambitious, there is still a [call open for the coveted title of CTF organizers](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-ctf-cfo.html)! Only a little over two weeks left to put in your proposal to be the future of DEF CON Capture the Flag!  
  
On the horizon very soon will be the Call for Contests! Polish those proposals for new DEF CON contests now and be ready for the call!  
  
We only turn 30 once. Let's do it big!
