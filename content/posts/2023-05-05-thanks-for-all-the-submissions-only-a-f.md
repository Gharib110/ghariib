# Thanks for all the Submissions Only a few open calls left

<br/>

<br/>

Thanks to everyone who’s submitted to the many DEF CON 31 Calls that closed out this week. We’re seeing great participation and we want to express our gratitude to everyone who’s willing to get involved.  
  
We’d like to remind you that [there are still calls open](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfi.html), especially on the Village level. You can check if your favorite event/contest/village is still accepting submissions a few ways. [Forum.defcon.org has a DC31 planning section](https://forum.defcon.org/node/243392) that is probably the most complete way to find info. We’ve also got a calendar at [forum.defcon.org/calendar](https://forum.defcon.org/calendar).  
  
DEF CON is what you make it. Rolling up your sleeves and sharing with the community can take your DC experiencee to the next level, so don’t miss this opportunity to get involved. We’re getting into the home stretch toward DC31, and we’ll be together again in Vegas before you know it.  
  
Let’s GOOooOO!
