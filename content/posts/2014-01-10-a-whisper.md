_Winter Break of Code, Day Four_

At the Open Whisper Systems [spring break of code](https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/) in 2013, I started work on [TextSecure iOS](https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS). People are chomping at the bit to use our software on iOS. After a hiatus from the project, Iâ€™ve been happy to return to it over the last few months, joining some other contributors, including [Frederic Jacobs](https://www.fredericjacobs.com/) as co-lead, [Alban Diquet](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3), and [Claudiu-Vlad Ursache](http://www.cvursache.com/) submitting pull requests, even over the holidays, with important cryptographic storage and UI-polishing contributions, and Bitcoin donations coming in from around the world.

[Contribute code](https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS) or [coins](https://whispersystems.org/blog/bithub/).
