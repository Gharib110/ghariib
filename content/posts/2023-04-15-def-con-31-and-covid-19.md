DC31 is on the horizon, and once again it’s time to talk COVID measures. This year we’re changing our mask policy from ‘required’ to ‘recommended’.  
  
There’s been a lot of improvement in the situation from the last three years, but we’re not out of the woods just yet and masking remains the safest bet, especially in crowded spaces.  
  
For the reasoning behind the decision and the mitigations we’re putting in place for DC31, [check out DT’s post here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-covid.html). Thanks for all you do to look out for each other. We’ll see you soon.
