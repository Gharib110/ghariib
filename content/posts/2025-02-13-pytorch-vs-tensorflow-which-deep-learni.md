# PyTorch vs TensorFlow Which Deep Learning Framework is Better in 2025

<br/>

<br/>
[Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)
----------------------------------------------

The advent of deep learning has changed the landscape of artificial intelligence. This shift has improved many areas, including image analysis, natural language understanding, customized recommendations, and self-driving technology. A key contributor to these developments is the suite of libraries and frameworks that enable the design, training, and deployment of complex neural networks. Among these, two standout frameworks emerge as essential tools for programmers: [PyTorch](/community/tutorials/pytorch-101-understanding-graphs-and-automatic-differentiation) and [TensorFlow](/community/tutorials/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-ubuntu-20-04).

This article will provide a comprehensive comparison of these two frameworks by exploring their backgrounds, structural differences, user-friendliness, performance benchmarks, and community engagement.

[What is PyTorch](#what-is-pytorch)[](#what-is-pytorch)
-------------------------------------------------------

PyTorch stands out as an open-source library for machine learning, characterized by its user-friendly Pythonic interface that enhances debugging and customization. Its dynamic computation graph and flexible architecture make it particularly advantageous for research and prototyping. However, compared to TensorFlow, its ecosystem is less extensive, and it tends to be less optimized for large-scale production environments.

[What is TensorFlow](#what-is-tensorflow)[](#what-is-tensorflow)
----------------------------------------------------------------

TensorFlow is a powerful open-source framework tailored for machine learning and numerical computations, using static computational graphs. It provides efficient production deployment, a wide range of toolkits, and is particularly suited for mobile and embedded devices. However, Despite its scalability, TensorFlow has a steeper learning curve. It also offers less flexibility for experimental research when compared to PyTorch.

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)[](#prerequisites)
-------------------------------------------------

-   Understanding the principles behind neural networks, the training process, and advanced deep learning frameworks, such as [Convolutional Neural Networks](/community/tutorials/writing-cnns-from-scratch-in-pytorch) and [Transformers](/community/tutorials/transformers-for-language-translation-classification).
-   Hands-on experience in Python programming, alongside essential libraries like [NumPy](/community/tags/numpy) and popular frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, including APIs like Keras and PyTorch Lightning.
-   Knowledge of [GPUs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/gpu/), [TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu), [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone), mixed-precision training strategies, and using debugging tools like TensorBoard to enhance performance.
-   Understanding model deployment systems like [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving) and [TorchServe](https://pytorch.org/serve/), cloud platforms including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.

[Historical Context and Evolution](#historical-context-and-evolution)[](#historical-context-and-evolution)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Originally launched by the Google Brain team in 2015, TensorFlow rapidly became the preferred framework for deep learning. This was mainly due to its focus on scalability and deployment capabilities in real-world applications.

In contrast, PyTorch emerged in 2016, providing a fresh, Python-oriented perspective on the Torch framework developed by Facebook’s AI Research division. With its user-friendly interface and adaptable computation graph, PyTorch quickly became popular among researchers.

Both frameworks have evolved considerably over time. The introduction of [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) in 2019 represented an important transition towards enhanced usability and eager execution. This improvement successfully tackles many of the issues highlighted in earlier iterations.

At the same time, PyTorch has persistently improved its features and broadened its ecosystem, progressively matching TensorFlow in readiness for production use.

[Dynamic vs. Static Graphs](#dynamic-vs-static-graphs)[](#dynamic-vs-static-graphs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the frequent points of comparison between PyTorch and TensorFlow lies in their approach to graph management—the difference between [dynamic and static graphs](/community/tutorials/pytorch-101-understanding-graphs-and-automatic-differentiation). Although TensorFlow 2.x embraces eager execution, enabling a more imperative programming approach, it also offers a legacy and optimizations geared towards a static graph framework.

![Graph Models in AI Framework](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/graph_models_in_AI_frameworks.png)

### [Dynamic Graph Advantages](#dynamic-graph-advantages)[](#dynamic-graph-advantages)

For instance, if a developer wants a specific layer to perform differently during each forward pass, PyTorch’s dynamic graph feature allows instant experimentation without requiring distinct graph definitions or session executions.

For example if we consider the following code snippet:

```
import torch
y = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0]); print(y**3 if y.sum() > 3 else y/3)
```

PyTorch builds the computation graph dynamically, allowing you to incorporate logical branches (if x.sum() > 3) directly in Python, with interpretation occurring at runtime.

### [Static Grpah Advantages](#static-grpah-advantages)[](#static-grpah-advantages)

On the other hand, TensorFlow’s static graph model—while improved with eager execution in its recent iterations—holds the capacity to optimize performance once the graph is defined. The system can analyze, optimize, and transform the entire graph before execution.

Using a static graph also improves efficiency in production settings. For example, with TensorFlow Serving, you can freeze a graph and rapidly deploy it in a high-performance context.

Let’s consider the code below in Tensorflow 2.x:

```
import tensorflow as tf

  @tf.function
  def operation(y, z):
      return tf.where(tf.reduce_sum(y) > 3, y**3, y/3)
  y = tf.constant([2.0, 3.0, 4.0])  
  z = tf.constant([3.0, 4.0])
  res = operation(y, z)
  print(res.numpy())
```

Using the `tf.function` decorator converts this Python function internally into a static graph. Although TensorFlow 2.x allows for eager execution, `tf.function` compiles operations into a static graph for potential optimizations. This demonstrates the legacy of TensorFlow’s static graph architecture.

### [Bridging Dynamic and Static Graph Execution](#bridging-dynamic-and-static-graph-execution)[](#bridging-dynamic-and-static-graph-execution)

PyTorch uses [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html), which connects dynamic graph execution with the capacity to trace or script models into a more defined, static structure. This approach not only provides potential performance gains but also simplifies deployment while keeping the dynamic experience required for prototyping.

TensorFlow’s eager mode provides a developer experience akin to that of PyTorch, with minor variations in debugging and architectural management. However, it remains possible to create a static graph for production purposes.

Below is a brief illustration of how to use TorchScript to convert a PyTorch function into a static traced graph, all while starting from a dynamic (eager) context:

```
import torch
  script = torch.jit.trace(torch.nn.Linear(3, 2), torch.randn(1, 3));
  print(script.code)
```

-   `torch.jit.trace( )` monitors your model (torch.nn.Linear(3, 2)) using a sample tensor input (torch.randn(1, 3)).
-   `script.code` will display the TorchScript code that will be generated. This demonstrates the transition of PyTorch from a dynamic graph configuration to a trace-based static representation.

[Development Experience and Syntax](#development-experience-and-syntax)[](#development-experience-and-syntax)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For many developers, the main selling point of a framework is how easy it is to code day-in-and-day-out.

### [Imperative vs. Declarative](#imperative-vs-declarative)[](#imperative-vs-declarative)

PyTorch predominantly follows an imperative programming style, which lets you write code that executes commands immediately. This makes identifying errors straightforward, as Python’s stack traces highlight issues directly as they occur. This approach is familiar with users accustomed to traditional Python or libraries like [NumPy](/community/tags/numpy).

![Pytorch and Tensorflow 2x](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/pytorch_tensorflow2x.png)

On the other hand, TensorFlow 2.x adops eager execution, allowing you to write in a similar imperative manner

### [API Layers](#api-layers)[](#api-layers)

It’s common for developers to use the `torch.nn` module or other enhanced tools such as `torchvision` for image-related tasks, or `torchtext` for processing natural language. Another higher-level framework is [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/starter/introduction.html), which reduces the boilerplate code involved in tasks like training loops, checkpointing, and [multi-GPU](/community/tutorials/multi-gpu-on-raw-pytorch-with-hugging-faces-accelerate-library) support.

[Keras](/community/tutorials/implement-seq2seq-for-text-summarization-keras) is also recognized as a top choice for high-level APIs, allowing you to operate in a straightforward imperative manner. Using Keras, you can also take a complex approach with `tf.function` decorators that optimize graph optimization. Its popularity stems mainly from its ease of use, making it particularly attractive for those aiming to deploy models without unnecessary complications.

### [Error Messaging and Debugging](#error-messaging-and-debugging)[](#error-messaging-and-debugging)

With dynamic graph execution models, error messages typically indicate the exact lines in your Python code that are causing issues. This feature is helpful for beginners or when tackling complex model structures.

Eager execution simplifies the debugging process compared to TensorFlow 1.x. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that certain errors might still be confusing when you combine eager execution with graph-based operations (via tf.function).

Let’s consider the following code:

```
import tensorflow as tf
  @tf.function
  def op(y): return y + "error"
  print(op(tf.constant([2.0, 3.0])))  # Triggers autograph conversion error
```

Output:

```
TypeError: Input 'y' of 'AddV2' Op has type string that does not match type float32 of argument 'x'.
```

The error arises instantly in the PyTorch example because it uses dynamic graph execution, meaning each operation takes place in real-time. Adding a string to a tensor is an invalid action, leading Python to issue a TypeError. This makes identifying and resolving the issue straightforward.

On the other hand, the TensorFlow example uses [@tf](/community/users/tf).function, which attempts to convert the function into a static computation graph. Instead of executing the function step by step, TensorFlow compiles it beforehand.

When an invalid operation (like appending a string to a tensor) is detected, the error emerges from TensorFlow’s internal graph conversion process. This makes debugging challenging compared to the immediate and clear feedback provided by PyTorch.

[Performance Considerations](#performance-considerations)[](#performance-considerations)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In deep learning, several factors influence performance levels. Key considerations include the training speed, effective [utilization of GPUs](/community/tutorials/monitoring-gpu-utilization-in-real-time), and proficiency in handling extensive models and datasets. PyTorch and TensorFlow use GPU acceleration, utilizing [NVIDIA CUDA](/community/tutorials/intro-to-cuda) or AMD ROCm, to boost the efficiency of tensor computations.

### [Low-level Optimizations](#low-level-optimizations)[](#low-level-optimizations)

TensorFlow is a framework for large-scale and distributed training using [_tf.distribute_](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MirroredStrategy), in addition to optimizing GPU performance. Its static graph model (which can be used optionally) enables improved performance through graph-level optimizations.

On the other hand, PyTorch has progressed over time, featuring well-developed backends and libraries. It supports distributed training through _[torch.distributed](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html)_ and includes improvements like `torch.cuda.amp` for implementing [automatic mixed precision.](/community/tutorials/automatic-mixed-precision-using-pytorch)

### [Mixed Precision and TPU Support](#mixed-precision-and-tpu-support)[](#mixed-precision-and-tpu-support)

PyTorch provides a user-friendly interface for mixed-precision training, enhancing performance on GPUs equipped with [Tensor Cores](/community/tutorials/understanding-tensor-cores). While PyTorch has improved its compatibility with [custom hardware](https://pytorch.org/xla/master/contribute/plugins.html), including Google’s TPUs, it does not match the native support that TensorFlow offers for these devices.

Tensorflow integrates [Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu), which are Google’s dedicated hardware designed to speed extensive deep learning tasks. Using TPUs typically requires minimal code changes in TensorFlow, which can be a considerable benefit if your infrastructure includes Google Cloud and TPUs.

### [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)[](#benchmarks)

Various third-party performance tests show that PyTorch and TensorFlow perform comparably well on common tasks, particularly with single-GPU training scenarios. Nevertheless, as configurations scale to multiple GPUs or nodes, results may vary depending on model specifics, dataset size, and the use of specialized hardware.

It is essential to note that both frameworks can handle high-performance tasks effectively. Influencing factors such as slight code optimizations, optimal hardware usage, and the nature of training jobs may be more critical than the choice of the framework itself.

[Ecosystem and Community Support](#ecosystem-and-community-support)[](#ecosystem-and-community-support)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When choosing a deep learning framework, an essential aspect to evaluate is the **supportive ecosystem** that encompasses libraries, contributions from the community, educational resources, and integration with cloud services.

![Choose the best deep learning framework for research and development](https://doimages.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/008ArticleImages/research_and_development_frameowrk.png)

Meanwhile, TensorFlow continues to have a strong presence in the research community, largely owing to its backing by Google and its proven reliability.

Improvements to the user experience in TensorFlow 2.x have drawn some researchers back into the fold. Nonetheless, PyTorch remains the framework of choice for many top AI research labs when developing and launching new model architectures.

[Deployment and Production Pipelines](#deployment-and-production-pipelines)[](#deployment-and-production-pipelines)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When choosing the right deep learning framework, it’s essential to consider not just the model training aspect but also the ease of model deployment.
