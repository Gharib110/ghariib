# Introduction to Nmap Part 2

<br/>

<br/>
Here is Part 2 of our video for understanding the basics of Nmap.Â  I discuss some of the logging output, the scripts found in Nmap, and the output that Nmap gives you for reporting or comparison later.

I really did want to go more into the Lua portion of the scripting engine, and perhaps make a simple script, but time constraints halted that. I hope to get more adept at video creation and hopefully editing, to make a more concise video tutorial.
