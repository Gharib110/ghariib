With Ubuntu 25.04 feature freeze now in effect the final licks of polish and paint have begun landing — including an update to Ubuntu’s Yaru theme. The Yaru theme is composed of a modified GTK4/libadwaita stylesheet, GNOME Shell theme, icon pack, and set of system sounds. With visual change and new features in GNOME 48 to account for, the design team working on Yaru have dutifully update the theme to accommodate. Most of the changes are subtle, but Yaru’s oversized icon bug I reported on last month? Fixes to address that did make it in. Thus, in 25.04 you may […]</p>

Earlier this year Ubuntu announced plans to replace document viewer app Evince with Papers, a modern GTK4/libadwaita fork1 of the former, in Ubuntu 25.04—today, the swap was made official. Papers is a fork of Evince that is actively maintained and makes use of newer technologies (GTK4, THIS), that are already present in Ubuntu. Upstream, GNOME 48 (out in March) opts to keep Evince as a core app but GNOME 49 is expected to switch to Papers. Ubuntu feels no reason to wait. Dabbled with daily builds of the Plucky Puffin prior to now? You might have noticed Papers isn’t present […]</p>

<p>SOC Prime is excited to announce a major upgrade to Uncoder AI—an industry-first integrated development environment (IDE) and co-pilot for threat-informed detection engineering. The new release introduces a robust set of features designed to enhance how detection rules are created, translated, and optimized, acting as a game-changer for security teams to stay ahead in the evolving cybersecurity landscape.</p>
<p>Start Now</p>
<p>In the past decade, detection engineering has evolved from a niche skill into a core function of cybersecurity, underscoring the growing demand for specialized expertise across a wide range of technologies. As organizations work to enhance their detection workflows and tackle the increasing complexity of cyber threats, AI and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape. Uncoder AI blends cutting-edge machine learning and automation with collective industry expertise, acting as a powerful co-pilot for security teams. </p>

		<p>Today, one of the greatest challenges that cyber defenders face is analyzing detection hits from indicator feeds, which provide metadata about specific indicators of compromise (IOCs), like IP addresses, ASNs, domains, URLs, and hashes. While indicator feeds have proliferated across the threat intelligence industry, most feeds contain no contextual information about why an indicator was placed on the feed. Another limitation of most feeds today is that they focus solely on blockable indicators and cannot easily accommodate more complex cases, such as a threat actor exploiting a CVE or an insider threat. Instead, this sort of complex threat intelligence is left for long form reporting. However, long-form reporting comes with its own challenges, such as the time required for writing and editing, which can lead to significant delays in releasing timely threat intelligence.</p>

		<p>Why VM escape threatens large organizations, and how you can defend against the threat.</p>
<p>On March 4, Broadcom released emergency updates to address three vulnerabilities — CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225 and CVE-2025-22226 — that affect several VMware products, including ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion. A note in the Broadcom advisory stated that at least one of these — CVE-2025-22224 — has been exploited in real-world attacks. The vulnerabilities allow for virtual machine escape — enabling attackers to execute code directly on the ESX hypervisor. Information available on VMware’s GitHub suggests that the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center was the first to detect the exploit in the wild and notify Broadcom. Neither company has named the attacker or the victim.</p>
