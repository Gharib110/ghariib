# Browsing more Securely

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we find ways to increase security when browsing the EWW (Evil Wide Web).

We give a shout-out to WhiteHatSec's Aviator browser as a way for everyone to have an eleveated security posture with very little configuration required. And Mr. Boettcher and I talk about some of the plugins we use to make ourselves more secure.

And Mr. Boettcher surprises me with his proclivities toward farmyard animals.
