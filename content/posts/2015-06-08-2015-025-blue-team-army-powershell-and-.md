# 2015-025 Blue Team Army Powershell and the need for Blue team education

<br/>

<br/>
With last week's revelation from Microsoft that they will support SSH, understanding powershell has become more important than ever as a tool to be used by blue teamers, both for adminstration, and to understand how bad guys will use it for nefarious deeds on your network.

Part 2 of our interview with Mick Douglas discusses a bit more about the DEV522 class that he teaches for SANS, and why it seems that blue team (defenders) are not getting the training they should. Â By being deficient in necessary skills, the knowledge between bad guys and the defenders widens.
