# Looking for 2404 Addresses

<br/>

<br/>
In the IANA IPv4 Address registry a block of addresses, 240.0.0.0/4 is marked as reserved for "Future Use"". If we have run out of available IPv4 addresses, then why are some quarter of a billion IPv4 addresses still sitting idle in an IANA registry waiting for an undefined Future Use?
