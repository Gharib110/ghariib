# A Vulnerability in Trimble Cityworks Could Allow for Remote Code Execution

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability has been discovered in Trimble Cityworks that could allow for remote code execution. Trimble Cityworks is a system that helps manage the lifecycle of assets for public infrastructure. It uses GIS (geographic information systems) to help with tasks such as permitting, licensing, construction, maintenance, and replacement. Successful exploitation of the of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
