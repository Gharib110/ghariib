<p>Digitization has significantly changed manufacturing over the past 25 years. The benefits include reducing inventory costs and machine downtime, and boosting throughput and forecasting accuracy. But as digitization has grown in prevalence, so have the security challenges facing manufacturers. This includes ransomware, legacy systems that are hard to patch, and third-party risk, among other types of threats. At the turn of the 21st century, production facilities were using software in various areas, but these systems were rarely integrated, and departments often operated in silos. Robotic assembly lines were already well established ‚Äì primarily in the automotive industry ‚Äì but were [‚Ä¶]</p>

		<p>In an era where discovering and rapidly mitigating security vulnerabilities is more important than ever before, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) is at the center of this work. MSRC focuses on investigating vulnerabilities, coordinating their disclosure, and releasing security updates to help protect customers and Microsoft from current and emerging cyberthreats related to security and privacy. MSRC partners with product teams across Microsoft‚Äîas well as external security researchers‚Äîto investigate reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services.</p>

		<p>Python is a core component of many enterprise environments. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) provides security-compliant Python streams with long life cycles. This commitment applies to Python 3.12 in RHEL 10 and older Python versions that serve as the main interpreters, such as Python 3.6 in RHEL 8 and Python 3.9 in RHEL 9.</p>

		<p>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) represents an alternative way to build, configure, install, deploy, and manage RHEL. In this tutorial, I will demonstrate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building a bootc container image containing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel and user space using¬† <code>container-tools</code>.</li>
<li>Using the¬†RHEL 9.5 Boot ISO and a Kickstart file to deploy this RHEL bootc image to a virtual machine (VM).</li>
<li>Managing image mode for RHEL, including how to update, roll back, and switch the image.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="image-mode-for-rhel">Image mode for RHEL</h2>
<p>By using <code>container-tools</code>, a container image is created which includes the RHEL kernel, boot loader, firmware, drivers, and ~440 RPM packages. This RHEL container image (also called RHEL bootc image) can be used to deploy RHEL in the data center or in the cloud, on bare-metal servers, virtual machines, or edge devices.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Have you ever wondered what the Dark Web is? How to access it? Or even better, how to deploy your site to the dark web? Well I got you today. In this article we shall look at how you can deploy your site on the Tor network, which is a Dark web that allows clients and Servers to navigate and exist on the Internet Anonymously.</p>
<p>The Internet is not all you see, it&rsquo;s divided into 2 parts, The Clearnet and The Darknet. They are differentiated by Traceability. You see on the Clearnet, when a message is sent over the network, it&rsquo;s easy to trace the client that sent it and the destination server that it was sent to. That&rsquo;s not the case on the Darknet, on the Darknet the location/IP address of the server and the client are not traceable. The client sends a message to the server but doesn&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s located.</p>
