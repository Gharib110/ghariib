# Some new Data Feeds and a little incident Thu Mar 20th

<br/>

<br/>
Our API ([DShield API - SANS Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu/api)) continues to be quite popular. One query we see a lot is lookups for individual IP addresses. Running many queries as you go through a log may cause you to get locked out by our rate limit. To help with that, we now offer additional “summary feeds” that include all data recently received. You may download these feeds and import them in your database of choice (or grep the text file for records). This will make bulk lookups a lot easier and faster.
