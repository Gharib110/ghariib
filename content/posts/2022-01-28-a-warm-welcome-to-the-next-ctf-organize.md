Big DEF CON 30 CTF update! Following several years of exemplary service by the Order of the Overflow, our world-famous Capture the Flag contest is under new management. The care and feeding of this year’s CTF is in the worthy and capable hands of the Nautilus Institute!  
  
From Nautilus Institute:  
  
**Ahoy DEF CON and CTF communities!  
  
We are the Nautilus Institute. We have been chosen, from a very respectable pool of applicants, to steer the DEF CON CTF ship starting in 2022. We are thankful for this honor, and hope to navigate straight and true no matter what waters lie ahead.  
  
We’re a bit light on details, while we prepare for this year’s DEF CON CTF Qualifiers May 28-29, but we hope to flag you down with more information soon! Please follow us on twitter at [https://twitter.com/Nautilus\_CTF](https://twitter.com/Nautilus_CTF) and keep a look out on our website at [https://nautilus.institute](https://nautilus.institute).  
  
Sea you soon,  
  
@•̂≈**  
  
For the boldest and best prepared, glory awaits. Godspeed.
