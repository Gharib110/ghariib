# Graphtage A New Semantic Diffing Tool

<br/>

<br/>
Graphtage is a command line utility and underlying library for semantically comparing and merging tree-like structures such as JSON, JSON5, XML, HTML, YAML, and TOML files. Its name is a portmanteau of “graph” and “graftage” (i.e., the horticultural practice of joining two trees together so they grow as one). Read on for what Graphtage does differently and better, why we developed it, how it works, and directions for using it as a library.
