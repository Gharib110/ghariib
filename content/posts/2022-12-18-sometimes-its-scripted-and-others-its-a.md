# Sometimes its scripted and others its a target of opportunity Hacking Humans Goes to the Movies

<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for joining us again for another episode of fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Hacking Humans co-host Dave Bittner is joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies and television shows with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear Dave and co-host Joe Carrigan talk about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave and Rick watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then they deconstruct what they saw. Grab your bowl of popcorn and join us for some fantastic scams and frauds. On this episode, Dave and Rick are joined once again by Tracy Maleeff, security researcher at the Krebs Stamos Group. You may also know Tracy on Twitter as infosecsherpa. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Rick's clip from the movie Criminal Tracy's clip from the movie The Talented Mr. Ripley
