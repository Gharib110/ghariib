# Tyler Hudak discusses malware analysis

<br/>

<br/>
Tyler Hudak (@secshoggoth) came to discuss with us the process of doing analysis on malware binaries. We talk about MASTIFF, his malware framework.  We also discuss how to gain information from malware program headers, and some software that is used to safely analyze it.
