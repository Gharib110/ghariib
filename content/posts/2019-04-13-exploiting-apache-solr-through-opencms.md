During one of my last Penetration Test I was asked to analyze some [OpenCMS](http://www.opencms.org/en/) instances. Before the assessment I wasn’t really familiar with OpenCMS, so I spent some time on the official documentation in order to understand how it works, which is the default configuration and if there are some security-related configurations which I should check during the test.
