Shielder, with [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), performed a Security Audit on a subset of the [Boost](https://boost.org/) C++ libraries. The audit resulted in five (5) findings ranging from low to medium severity plus two (2) informative notices. The Boost maintainers of the affected libraries addressed some of the issues, while some other were acknowledged as accepted risks.

**Today, we are publishing the [full report](https://github.com/ShielderSec/public-reports/blob/main/2024/%5BOSTIF%5D%20Boost%20-%20Report%20v1.4.pdf) in our [dedicated repository](https://github.com/ShielderSec/public-reports/)**.

Introduction
------------

In December 2023, Shielder was hired to perform a Security Audit of [Boost](https://boost.org/), a set of free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The audit has been sponsored by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and facilitated by the [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF)](https://ostif.org/).
