# 2016-020-College Vs Certifications Vs Self-taught

<br/>

<br/>
Dr. Matt Miller is a professor at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. We had him on to discuss a matter that seems to weigh heavily on the infosec community. What will a CS degree get you? What are you learning these days as a future code jockey? Is skipping college altogether better?

We discuss what he does to arm future developers with the tools necessary to get a job. We hear about what they also might be lacking in as well.

Dr. Miller is also spearheading a new cybersecurity degree track at his university. We discuss what it's like to head that up, and we even get into a bit of discussion on Assembly language.

We also discuss free alternatives for learning out there, and how effective they are.
