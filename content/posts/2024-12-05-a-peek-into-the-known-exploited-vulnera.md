# A Peek Into the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities of 2024

<br/>

<br/>
\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\* VulnCheck now provides an automated approach to providing broader visibility into differences between VulnCheck KEV and CISA KEV through a Jupyter Notebook publicly available on GitHub.\\n\* During 2024 (year-to-date), VulnCheck KEV added 717 new known exploited vulnerabilities (average of 59.8/month) vs. 170 added to CISA KEV (average of 14.2/month).\\n\* During 2024 (year-to-date), VulnCheck KEV added 410 unique vendors with one or more KEV vs. 56 unique vendors in CISA KEV.\\n\* The top 10 vendors by number of exploited vulnerabilities in 2024 include Microsoft (55), Apache (18), Ivanti (17), Apple (16), D-Link (14), Oracle (14), Google (13), Cisco (11), Progress (11) and VMware (11).\\n\* The top 10 products with exploited vulnerabilities in 2024 include Microsoft Windows (30), Google Chrome / Chromium (11), Apple IOS products (9), Apache OFBiz (6), Ivanti Connect Secure (6), Citrix Netscaler (6), Apple Safari (5), Cisco ASA / FTD (5), QNAP QTS (5), and openSSL (5).\\n\\nVideo Walkthrough: Vulncheck KEV Jupyter Notebook\\n\\n\\n\\nLast month, we forewent our monthly update on known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) and put that work towards building an automated approach to reviewing KEV trends that is easy for anyone to copy, modify and use. Our goal is to provide broader visibility into differences between VulnCheck KEV and CISA KEV using a public Jupyter Notebook that is automatically updated on a daily basis.\\n\\nThe Jupyter Notebook is available on VulnCheck’s Github \[Github\](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/vulncheck-kev/vulncheck-kev-dashboard.ipynb) to use and works with our free community edition if you want to build your own Vulncheck KEV dashboard.\\n\\n## 2024 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Statistics (CISA KEV vs. Vulncheck KEV)\\n\\n!\[Vulnerabilities, Exploitation, Exploits\](/blog/comparing-kevs-jupyter/kev-stats-2024.png){:width="100%"}\\n\\nThe first area we explored was the volume differences between VulnCheck KEV and CISA KEV. To visualize this, we created a top-level dashboard highlighting key statistics for 2024, including:\\nThe total number of KEVs added. VunCheck KEV added 717 new known exploited vulnerabilities, while CISA KEV added 170.\\n\\nThe average number of KEVs added per month. Vulncheck averaged 59.8 KEVs per month, while CISA averaged 14.2 per month. The number of unique vendors with at least one KEV. There are 410 unique vendors that had 1 or more KEV added to VulnCheck, while CISA covered 56 vendors. The number of unique products represented. VulnCheck added KEVs with 1 or more KEV while CISA added 98.\\n\\nThis dashboard provides a clear comparison of vendor and product coverage between VulnCheck KEV and CISA KEV.\\n\\n## Exploring CISA KEV & VulnCheck KEV by Vendor & Product\\n\\nGiven the significant disparity in the number of vendors and products between CISA KEV and VulnCheck KEV, we created an interactive explorer to help visualize and explore the data. To achieve this, we used an interactive treemap within a Jupyter notebook. To interact with these treemaps, simply download the Jupyter notebook and open it in a tool like VS Code.\\n\\n### Exploring VulnCheck KEV Vendors / Products\\n\\n!\[Vulnerabilities, Exploitation, Exploits\](/blog/comparing-kevs-jupyter/vulncheck-kev-2024.png){:width="100%"}\\n\\nBased on exploit intelligence first captured by VulnCheck in 2024, the top 10 vendors by number of exploited vulnerabilities include Microsoft (55), Apache (18), Ivanti (17), Apple (16), D-Link (14), Oracle (14), Google (13), Cisco (11), Progress (11) and VMware (11).\\n\\nBased on exploit intelligence first captured by VulnCheck in 2024, the top 10 products by exploited vulnerabilities include Microsoft Windows (30), Google Chrome / Chromium (11), Apple IOS products (9), Apache OFBiz (6), Ivanti Connect Secure (6), Citrix Netscaler (6), Apple Safari (5), Cisco ASA / FTD (5), QNAP QTS (5), and openSSL (5).\\n\\nThis data highlights the persistent targeting by threat actors across various platforms, including operating systems, browsers, web services, and network edge devices. Notably, products such as Hiltron DVR, Netlify OpenMetadata, and Paytium were omitted from this list due to the issuance of multiple CVEs for similar vulnerabilities simultaneously or their relatively lower prevalence.\\n\\n### Exploring CISA KEV by Vendors / Products\\n\\n!\[Vulnerabilities, Exploitation, Exploits\](/blog/comparing-kevs-jupyter/cisa-kev-2024.png){:width="100%"}\\n\\nThe top 10 vendors by number of vulnerabilities that CISA added to KEV in 2024 include Microsoft (34), Ivanti (11), Adobe (7), Apple (7), Android (6), CIsco (6) D-Link (6), Palo Alto Networks (6), Apache (5), and VMware (5).\\n\\nThe top 10 products added to CISA KEV include Microsoft Windows (22), Google Chrome/Chromium (9), Cisco ASA / FTD (5), Apple IOS Products (5), Abode Flash Player (4), Android Pixel (4), VMware Vcenter (4), Linux Kernel (4)\\n\\nAdditionally, there’s a notable distinction in the vulnerabilities added to the CISA KEV list. Many, such as those in Adobe Flash, had exploitation evidence publicly available years prior. This underscores differences between newly exploited vulnerabilities and the re-emergence of previously known vulnerabilities, a topic I’ll explore later in this post.\\n\\n## Comparing 2024 KEVS added to CISA KEV and VulnCheck KEV by day, month and year\\n\\nTo understand the frequency at which Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) were added throughout the year, we created a calendar chart inspired by Jerry Gamblin’s \[cve.icu\](https://cve.icu/CVECalendar.html){:target="\_blank"} project. These visualizations highlight the additional patterns for KEVs across CISA KEV and VulnCheck KEV.\\n\\n!\[Vulnerabilities, Exploitation, Exploits\](/blog/comparing-kevs-jupyter/kev-calendar.png){:width="100%"}\\n\\nLooking at VulnCheck KEV, we see a consistent amount of exploitation activity seen for the first time throughout the year, with some larger numbers highlighted in yellow. These tend to be quarterly industry reports disclosing a larger number of vulnerabilities with observed exploitation. The highest number of vulnerabilities with exploitation evidence being added to VulnCheck KEV in a single day was 55. It’s also interesting to see a lull during US holiday seasons like Thanksgiving. We're not sure if it's security researchers or threat actors that take a break. LOL\\n\\nWhen we look at CISA KEV, the number of vulnerabilities added is much sparser and tends to group during the weekend days, specifically Monday - Thursday, with only 4 instances of a KEV being reported on Fridays. CISA has not issued a single KEV during the weekend this year.\\n\\n## Historical Exploitation Evidence Availability Before CISA KEV (All CISA KEVs)\\n\\n!\[Vulnerabilities, Exploitation, Exploits\](/blog/comparing-kevs-jupyter/cisa-kev-exploitation-availability.png){:width="100%"}\\n\\nNext, we analyzed the time gap between vulnerabilities being added to CISA KEV and the availability of publicly documented exploitation evidence in VulnCheck KEV. By reviewing all historical CISA KEVs and mapping the dates of publicly available exploitation evidence.\\n\\nTime Gap Insights: In 53.4% of cases, exploitation evidence is publicly available more than one month prior to the vulnerability being added to CISA KEV.\\n\\nSame-Day Evidence: When exploitation evidence and CISA KEV updates coincide on the same day, it typically occurs during Patch Tuesday, when exploitation evidence is widely documented and known to be coming from reliable sources.\\n\\nOn occassion we see unique evidence published from CISA that wasn't available elsewhere which is a smaller subset of the 327 vulnerabilities in the same day evidence bucket.\\n\\n## Explore VulnCheck KEV and CISA KEV Yourself\\nThe Jupyter Notebook used to generate this research is a free resource that uses VulnCheck’s Python SDK and community edition making it available to all.\\n\\nGet started today\\n1. \[Signup for VulnCheck Community\](https://vulncheck.com/community)\\n2. \[Download the Jupyter Notebook\](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/jupyter-notebooks/blob/main/vulncheck-kev/vulncheck-kev-dashboard.ipynb)\\n3. \[Enter your API key from VulnCheck\](https://docs.vulncheck.com/getting-started/api-tokens)\\n4.
