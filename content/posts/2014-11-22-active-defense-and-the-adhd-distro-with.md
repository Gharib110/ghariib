# Active Defense and the ADHD Distro with Ben Donnelly

<br/>

<br/>
We snagged an interview with Benjamin Donnelly, a maintainer of the Active Defense Harbinger Distribution (ADHD). version 0.60

A thoroughly enjoyable conversation with a new up-and-coming security professional. He's the future, and he is already contributing a lot of great info to the infosec industry.

Part 1 is all about ADHD, next week, we discuss his talk about a project he's working on that will remove the threat of password breaches using 'Ball and Chain'.  And it's all open source...
