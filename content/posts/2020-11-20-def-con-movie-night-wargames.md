#defconmovienight update for November 21  
  
Next week's movie will be the classic 80s hacker film 'War Games'.  
  
"But how? Don't the terms and conditions at discord forbid sharing copyrighted content?"  
  
Fair question.  
  
If we showed the movie in discord, we could run into issues. However, 'War Games' is showing for free on YouTube, praised be the internets.  
  
So the plan is to make it a double header. For the first hour, we'll show a talk from DEF CON 16 where The Dark Tangent interviews David Scott Lewis, engineer, consultant and the model for the David Lightman character in War Games. It's a fascinating interview that will give you a lot of insight into the main feature. If you want to watch it early, it's available at [https://youtu.be/hHDJpYBVgz0](https://youtu.be/hHDJpYBVgz0).  
  
Then, when the interview is over, we'll all synchronize watches and start up 'War Games' on YouTube. We'll still hang out and talk in movie-night-text like every week.  
  
Hopefully, stuff like this expands the pool of available content to be Movie Nighted, and if it works we'll do it again from time to time.  
  
Hope you'll join us at 8pm PST, November 21 in [discord.gg/defcon/](https://discord.gg/DEFCON/) in movie-night-text and movie-night-voice, and help us kick things up a notch.
