Let’s ring in the New Year together! We’re putting together a free online party for the global DEF CON Community. Join us on our Discord server ([https://discord.gg/defcon/](https://discord.gg/DEFCON/)) for some low-key DC-style amusements like Hacker Jeopardy, Drunk Hacker History, live music, movies - you know how we do. No talks, no lines, plenty of hacker fellowship and shenanigans.

We’ll provide the tunes, the games and contests, even some ‘celebrity’ bartenders. You just bring your dancing shoes and the refreshments of your choice.
