This week, we discuss hardening of windows hosts, utilizing CIS benchmarks. We talk about the 'auditpol' command. And we dredge up from the ancient times (2000) the Microsoft article from Scott Culp "The 10 Immutable Laws of Security Administration". Are they still applicable to today's environment, 17 years later?
