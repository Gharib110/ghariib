# Repo swatting attack deletesblocks GitHub and GitLab accounts

<br/>

<br/>
A technique called "repo swatting" allows attackers to delete GitHub and block GitLab accounts by exploiting file upload features and abuse reporting mechanisms. Attackers upload malicious files to a target's repository, then report the account for hosting malicious content, potentially resulting in account deletion. The vulnerability was partially mitigated by October 2024 via changes in upload URL paths and requirement for each uploader to be authenticated (in GitHub).
