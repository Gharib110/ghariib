# Active Defense It aint hacking the hackers

<br/>

<br/>
Active Defense... It conjures images of the lowly admin turning the tables on the evil black hat hackers, and giving them a dose of their own medicine by hacking their boxes and getting sweet, sweet revenge... But did you know that kind of 'revenge' is also rife with legal rammifications, even bordering on being illegal??

This week, Mr. Boettcher and I tackle this prickly subject, and discuss some software you can use to 'deter, prevent, and dissuade' potential bad guys...
