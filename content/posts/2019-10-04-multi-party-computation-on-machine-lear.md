# Multi-Party Computation on Machine Learning

<br/>

<br/>
During my internship this summer, I built a multi-party computation (MPC) tool that implements a 3-party computation protocol for perceptron and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. MPC enables multiple parties to perform analyses on private datasets without sharing them with each other. I defveloped a technique that lets three parties obtain the results of machine \[â€¦\]
