		<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux, RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 use modularity to distribute various database streams. Modules have many advantages, but also minor drawbacks. RHEL 10 comes with a post-modular solution. This new innovative concept focuses on transparency for users. </p>
<p>Basic knowledge about using the <code>dnf</code> utility is sufficient to start working with a parallel database stream in RHEL 10. This article describes the RHEL 10 post-modular solution for distributing database streams.</p>

		<p>Docker simplifies containerization by removing runtime complexity and making app development seamless. With Docker Engine v28, we’re taking another step forward in security by ensuring containers aren’t unintentionally accessible from local networks. This update isn’t about fixing a single vulnerability — it’s about security hardening so your containers stay safe. </p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>When you run a container on the default Docker “bridge” network, Docker sets up <strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong> rules using your system’s firewall (via iptables). For example, the following command forwards traffic from port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. </p>

	<div>
		<p>For several years now, the big cloud service providers – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – have tried to get wireless network operators to run their 5G SA core network, edge computing and various distributed applications on their cloud platforms. For example, Amazon’s AWS public cloud, Microsoft’s Azure for Operators, and Google’s Anthos for Telecom were intended to get network operators to run their core network functions into a hyperscaler cloud.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Observability is critical for web operations to ensure that the application is working as expected and to identify any potential issues. However, setting up observability has traditionally been challenging because it can take hours to set up all the infrastructure, instrument your code and enable observability in production. But now there is a better way using native support for Django in Charmcraft and Rockcraft which has observability built in and ready to go!</p>

		<p>At Cloudflare, we believe that every political candidate — regardless of their affiliation — should be able to run their campaign without the constant worry of cyber attacks. Unfortunately, malicious actors, such as nation-states, financially motivated attackers, and hackers, are often looking to disrupt campaign operations and messaging. These threats have the potential to interfere with the democratic process, weaken public confidence, and cause operational challenges for campaigns of all scales.</p>
