# 2015-032 Incident response effective communication and DerbyCon Contest

<br/>

<br/>
 In an incident response, the need for clear communication is key to effective management of an incident. This week, we had Mick Douglas, DFIR instructor at SANS, and Jarrod Frates, who is a pentester at InGuardians, and has great experience handling incidents. Find out some roles in an incident response (the Shadow, the event coordinator, the lead tech), and how companies should have an IR plan that handles various 'incident severities'.

Jarrod updates us on "TheLab.ms" and how you might like to help them! 

Finally, We are holding a contest to win a ticket to DerbyCon, full instructions are below. We are giving away two tickets.
