In preparation for DEF CON 30, we’ve updated the [transparency report](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-transparency.html) on the DEF CON website. While you’re there, take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [code of conduct](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-code-of-conduct.html). We don’t have a ton of rules, but we take the ones we have very seriously.
