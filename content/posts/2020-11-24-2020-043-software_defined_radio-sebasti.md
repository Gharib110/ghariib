Why we are here today?  
  

[Software Defined Radio (sdr-radio.com)](https://www.sdr-radio.com/)

What kind of hardware or software do you need? Why would a security professional want to know how to use SDR tools and attacks?

What other kinds of attacks can be launched? (I mean, other than replay type attacks)

Door systems (badge systems)

NFC? Contactless credit card attacks 

Smart building/home control systems

Bluetooth attacks

Point Of Sale systems

Cellular radio 3g/4g/5g

Industrial control systems

Home appliances

Medical telemetry systems

Drones!

Supply chain attacks - systems tend to use wireless chipsets or protocols

How does someone make a faraday cage on the cheap? (mentioned in one of your class agendas)

Lots of IoT devices use your typical home wifi connection, can’t you just sniff packets to get what you need?

What are the current limitations to testing wireless and RF related systems? What about custom wireless implementations?

Cellular?

Zigbee?

**I’m a wireless manufacturer of some kind of device. I’m freaked now by hearing you talk about how easy it is to attack wireless systems. What are some things I could do to ensure that the types of attacks we discussed here cannot affect me?**
