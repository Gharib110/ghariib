The full DEF CON [Transparency Report for DEF CON 29](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-transparency.html) is now available. Our deepest thanks to everyone who reported issues to us and also to the people on staff who tracked down and handled those issues. It's a community effort, and it's good to see the progress we're making.
