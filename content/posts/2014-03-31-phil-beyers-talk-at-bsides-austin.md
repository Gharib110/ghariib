# Phil Beyers talk at Bsides Austin

<br/>

<br/>
We are pleased to be the only podcast to have audio of the talk Phil Beyer gave at Bsides Austin!Â  It is a very informative talk about leadership, not just in Information Security, but how to be a leader in any field you do.

Breaking Down Security will also carry a 2 part interview with Phil. The first will post on the 6th of April, and the 2nd part will be on the 13th of April.

Phil uploaded the slides of this presentation at Bsides Austin at [http://www.slideshare.net/pjbeyer/choose-to-lead](http://www.slideshare.net/pjbeyer/choose-to-lead).

Brakeing Down Security would like to thank Phil Beyer for his time and generosity.
