# 2015-039 Hazards of HTML5

<br/>

<br/>
Shreeraj Shah (@shreeraj on Twitter) came on this week to give us a run-down of some of the issues with HTML5? How can a new standard actually be worse than something like Flash? And why would a standard not address existing OWASP issues, and even create new issues, like the ability of a browser to have a database inside of it managing everything?

This week we discuss HTML5 history, some of the pitfalls, and discuss some of the new technologies found in HTML5 that will create more headaches for agents of infosec.
