Now that we’ve got the venue stuff sorted out, we’re ready to announce the DEF CON 32 theme!  
  
This year’s theme is “Engage”. The internet may be trending toward a dystopia of dark patterns and walled gardens, but we can do better. We know how. The antidote to apathy and doomscrolling is engagement. You can read The Dark Tangent’s full post about it here: [https://forum.defcon.org/node/248361](https://forum.defcon.org/node/248361).  
  
The visual vibes are Y2K inspired and you can get your color palette, fonts and whatnot in the [DEF CON 32 style guide](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-theme.html).  
  
As always, we are excited to see where you’ll take this. Let’s GO.
