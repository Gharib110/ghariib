# CISA Adds Two Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog

<br/>

<br/>
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog "Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"), based on evidence of active exploitation.

-   [CVE-2025-24472](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-24472 "CVE-2025-24472") Fortinet FortiOS and FortiProxy Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
-   [CVE-2025-30066](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30066 "CVE-2025-30066") tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action Embedded Malicious Code Vulnerability

These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.

[Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01 "Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities") established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the [BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf "BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet") for more information.

Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of [Catalog vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog "Catalog vulnerabilities") as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the [specified criteria](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities "specified criteria").
