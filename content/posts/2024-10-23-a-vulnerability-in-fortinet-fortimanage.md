# A Vulnerability in Fortinet FortiManager Could Allow for Remote Code Execution

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability has been discovered in Fortinet FortiManager which could allow for remote code execution. FortiManager is a network and security management tool that provides centralized management of Fortinet devices from a single console. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
