# Black Badge Hall of Fame updated

<br/>

We’ve overhauled the [Black Badge Hall of Fame page](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-black-badge.html)! For anyone unfamiliar, the BBHOF is our online record of everyone who’s won DEF CON’s ultimate prize- a limited edition badge that comes with lifetime free entry and eternal glory. If you’re not on the list, maybe it’s time to get a plan together.  
  
And while we’re talking about contests, you can check the [contest results for DC31 here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-contest-results.html). Congratulations to the winners and respect to everyone who gets in the arena.
