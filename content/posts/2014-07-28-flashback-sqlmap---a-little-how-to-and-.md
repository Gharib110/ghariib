# Flashback Sqlmap - a little how-to and getting your developers involved in using it

<br/>

<br/>
This is a flashback from July 2015. 

Mr. Boettcher and I discussed SQLMAP, a tool that can automate the process of pentesting databases and even registries on Windows.  We discuss some functions of the program and why developers should get training on these.

Mr. Boettcher and I talk about how Infosec professionals should help to educate QA and Developers to be able to look at their processes and incorporate security testing, using tools like sqlmap in the Software lifecycle.
