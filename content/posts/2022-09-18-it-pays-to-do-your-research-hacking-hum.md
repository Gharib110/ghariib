Thanks for joining us again for another episode of fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Co-hosts Dave Bittner and Joe Carrigan are joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave and Joe are joined on this episode by guest Tracy Maleeff from Krebs Stamos Group – you may know her on Twitter as @Infosecsherpa. Dave,Joe and Tracy watch and discuss Tracy;s and Joe's clips on this episode. They watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then the team deconstructs what they saw. Grab your bowl of popcorn and join us for some Hollywood scams and frauds. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Tracy's clips from "Working Girl" Elevator scene Tess and Jack gatecrash a wedding scene Joe's clip from "Oceans 8"
