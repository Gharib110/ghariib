# 2016-024 Kim Green on CISOaaS the Redskins Laptop and HIPAA

<br/>

<br/>
We are pleased to introduce Ms. Kim Green (Twitter: @kim1green). She is the CEO of KAZO Security, as well as the CISO/CPO of Zephyr Health, a #SaaS based #Healthcare data #analytics company.  She brings over 20 years of experience in healthcare and leadership to help small and medium business companies get help from a #CISO to assist in an advisory role.

Ms. Green also started a bug bounty program at Zephyr Health to assist them in shoring up their application, finding #vulnerabilities that their internal teams may have missed. We are going to discuss with her why they decided to make it a private bug bounty, and what was the result.

We also discuss why#HIPAA seems to be so far behind in terms of being able to protect #PHI/#PII and what if anything can be done to fix it.

We finish up discussing a recent news story about the how the National Football League (#NFL) team Washington Redskins had a trainer lose a laptop with the PII and health information on several thousand NFL players. We discuss why they did not violate HIPAA, and what if anything they did violate.
