# Client-Side SSRF to Google Cloud Project Takeover

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability in Vertex AI Workbench allowed attackers to take over victims' Google Cloud projects through client-side SSRF. The initial bug involved unauthorized access to authentication tokens, which was later fixed. A bypass was later discovered (and also fixed) using open redirects in Feedburner and CSRF token manipulation.
