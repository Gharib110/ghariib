# Mr Boettcher interviewed Ed Skoudis

<br/>

<br/>
While I'm stuck at work, Mr. Boettcher went to the Austin Hackformers and snagged an interview with Mr. Ed Skoudis, of InGuardians and of the SANS Institute, a top flight training academy.  He is to be one of the keynote speakers at DerbyCon this year. He gives us a peek about his keynote, and Mr. Boettcher asks his thoughts on the industry as a whole, SCADA security, Mr. Skoudis' opinion on Infosec as a whole.
