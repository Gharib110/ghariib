Friendly DEF CON reminder: The [DEF CON group discount](https://book.passkey.com/go/SHDEF3) ends Friday the 14th at midnight PDT! After that, you’re stuck with the prevailing Vegas rate. If you’ve been procrastinating, take this as the universe telling you to get to clicking.  
  
Reminder pt. 2 - The Horseshoe is a real hotel, and it’s really in our room block. It’s the new name for Bally’s. Same location, just with a whole lot of upgrades.
