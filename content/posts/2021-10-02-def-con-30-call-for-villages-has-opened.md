DEF CON 30 may seem a long way off, but it’s never too soon to start planning. Especially for something as close to the heart of the DEF CON experience as Villages.  
  
As always, we’re looking for new villages that will create welcoming, hands-on spaces for congoers to sharpen their skills, learn something new and maybe even find their newest obsession.  
  
Space (both physical and metaphorical) is limited. Early submissions have increased chances of success. If the concept is strong but needs work, we can help but only if we have enough time.  
  
You’ll want to famailiarize yourself with the requirements and submission guidelines at [https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfv.html](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfv.html) first. If you can meet the preconditions, and you have a stellar idea to propose, that’s the universe telling you it’s go time. Rise to meet your moment.  
  
We can’t wait to see what’s on your mind.
