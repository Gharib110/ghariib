# Marcus J Carey FireDrillMe and the Rockstars of Infosec

<br/>

<br/>
Marcus J. Carey, a security research and software developer came on to talk to us about FireDrill.me, a tool used to help people work out their Incident Response muscles.  He is also the creator of threatagent.com.

Marcus is well known in Security circles, and after we talked to him about FireDrill and ThreatAgent, we got his opinion of other subjects that interested us in the Infosec industry. Marcus is a man of his own mind, and he certainly did not disappoint. Hope you enjoy Part 1 of our conversation with him.

We also asked him about the celebrity that many in the industry face, and how it should be handled by people in the industry.
