# 2015-020 - Deadly Programming Sins - Buffer Underruns

<br/>

<br/>
Code Audits are a necessary evil. Many organizations resort to using automated tools, but tools may not find all issues with code. Sometimes, you need to take a look at the code yourself.Â 

Mr. Boettcher and I begin going through the book "24 Deadly Sins of Software Security: Programming Flaws and How to Fix Them" What we covered this week is "buffer overruns", we discuss what they are, and how they occur.

Get ready for a crash course in code audits. The book is not required, but it definitely helps when we are discussing concepts.

We also mentioned our new Patreon account, so if you are a listener, and want to support what we do, you can give on a per month schedule. Donations are entirely optional, and if you don't wish to give, that's fine too.
