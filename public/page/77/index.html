<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>As a platform engineer at a mid-size startup, I’m responsible for identifying bottlenecks and developing solutions to streamline engineering operations to keep up with the velocity and scale of the engineering organization. In this post, I outline some of the challenges we faced with one of our clients, how we addressed them, and provide guides on how to tackle these challenges at your company.</p>

<p>DEF CON 33 is building steam. Planning is in full swing. In fact, a glance at any nearby calendar will tell you we&rsquo;re already halfway there!</p>
<p>We know you need to plan, too. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re opening up Early Bird Online Registration. For the go-getters who register early, weve got our lowest online price. And just like in years past, registering online guarantees your badge, no matter what the attendance numbers turn out to be.</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity is no longer optional—especially for companies in the automotive industry managing sensitive data. The <strong>Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX)</strong> provides a structured approach for organizations to standardize their security measures, ensuring compliance with industry expectations while mitigating the risks of breaches and data leaks.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>For businesses looking to achieve <strong>TISAX certification</strong>, preparation is key. The process involves multiple levels of assessment and strict security requirements that align with ISO 27001 but extend to industry-specific concerns, such as prototype protection and data privacy.</p>

<p>I like to start long blog posts with a tl;dr, so here it is:</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve ingested a corpus of 1.5TB worth of stealer logs known as &ldquo;ALIEN TXTBASE&rdquo; into Have I Been Pwned. They contain 23 billion rows with 493 million unique website and email address pairs, affecting 284M unique email addresses. We&rsquo;ve also added 244M passwords we&rsquo;ve never seen before to Pwned Passwords and updated the counts against another 199M that were already in there. Finally, we now have a way for domain owners to query their entire domain for stealer logs and for website operators to identify customers who have had their email addresses snared when entering them into the site. (Note: stealer logs are still freely and easily searchable by individuals, scroll to the bottom for a walkthrough.)</strong></p>

<p>Scams are big business for cybercriminals, and they’re getting more sophisticated than ever. According to McAfee’s <em>State of the Scamiverse 2025</em> report, the average person encounters 12 scams per day, while Americans see over 14 scam attempts daily, including three deepfake videos.</p>
<p>Fraudsters are leveraging AI-powered tools to create hyper-realistic deepfakes for as little as $5 and 10 minutes, making it harder than ever to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. The financial impact is staggering—87% of scam victims lose money, with one-third losing over $500, and nearly one in ten losing more than $5,000. </p>
