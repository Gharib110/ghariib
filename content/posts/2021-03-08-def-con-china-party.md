We’re proud to announce another live online event! We’re working with our partners at Baidu and hosting a full one-day [DEF CON China Party](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-china-party/dc-china-party.html). Join us on March 20 in a specially built XRspace VR environment for a full day of our famous style of fun with music, speakers, contests and an interview with legendary hacker Steve Wozniak.

We’ll be announcing more details as the day approaches, so keep an eye on the party page for updates. We hope you’ll be able to join us, even if you don’t have a VR setup. See you there!
