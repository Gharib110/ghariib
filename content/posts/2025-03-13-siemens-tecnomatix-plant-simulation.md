# Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

<br/>

<br/>
As of January 10, 2023, CISA will no longer be updating ICS security advisories for Siemens product vulnerabilities beyond the initial advisory. For the most up-to-date information on vulnerabilities in this advisory, see [Siemens' ProductCERT Security Advisories (CERT Services | Services | Siemens Global).](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications "(opens in a new window)")

1\. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---------------------

-   **CVSS v4 7.0**
-   **ATTENTION**: Low attack complexity
-   **Vendor**: Siemens
-   **Equipment**: Tecnomatix Plant Simulation
-   **Vulnerabilities**: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties

2\. RISK EVALUATION
-------------------

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthorized attacker to read or delete arbitrary files or the entire file system of the device.

3\. TECHNICAL DETAILS
---------------------

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Siemens reports that the following products are affected:

-   Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302: All versions prior to V2302.0021
-   Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404: All versions prior to V2404.0010

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### **3.2.1** [**FILES OR DIRECTORIES ACCESSIBLE TO EXTERNAL PARTIES CWE-552**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/552.html)

The affected application does not properly restrict access to the file deletion functionality. This could allow an unauthorized attacker to delete files even when access to the system should be prohibited, resulting in potential data loss or unauthorized modification of system files.

[CVE-2025-25266](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25266) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2025-25266](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25266). A base score of 7.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

#### **3.2.2** [**FILES OR DIRECTORIES ACCESSIBLE TO EXTERNAL PARTIES CWE-552**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/552.html)

The affected application does not properly restrict the scope of files accessible to the simulation model. This could allow an unauthorized attacker to compromise the confidentiality of the system.

[CVE-2025-25267](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25267) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2025-25267](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-25267). A base score of 6.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)).

4\. MITIGATIONS
---------------

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:

-   Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302: Update to [V2302.0021](https://support.sw.siemens.com/product/297028302/) or later version
-   Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404: Update to [V2404.0010](https://support.sw.siemens.com/product/297028302/) or later version

As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) and following recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the [Siemens industrial security webpage](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity)

For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-507653 in [HTML](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-507653.html) and [CSAF](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/csaf/ssa-507653.json).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

-   Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
-   Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
-   When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize VPNs may have vulnerabilities, should be updated to the most recent version available, and are only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

-   Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
-   Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
-   Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
