# The Ultimate OSCP Preparation Guide DEPRECATED

<br/>

<br/>
The Ultimate OSCP Preparation Guide \[DEPRECATED\] Update Notes This guide is now deprecated due to exam revisions made by Offensive Security on January 11, 2022. I published this guide on August 17th, of 2020. Offensive Security no longer requires the buffer overflow, and to pass this exam, you’ll have to understand Active Directory hacking. Since I’m not going to retake the OSCP to update this resource, I’m discontinuing it. While I do plenty of AD hacking, I obviously haven’t used my resources to attempt an OSCP Active Directory Pass therefore I couldn’t recommend anything to you in-good faith.
