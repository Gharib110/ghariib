DEF CON Safe Mode is almost here! We hope you’re as excited as we are. For everyone looking to support DEF CON in this unusually difficult time, we have a new option for you to consider - Human PLUS.  
  
Safe Mode is free to all Humans, but you can upgrade to Human Plus for $20 USD on the DEF CON Discord for a few upgraded privileges. You get stuff like the ability to post pics and links, change your nick, access to Plus only chill out rooms and the good feeling that you’ve helped keep DEF CON alive until we meet again in Vegas. The information is all spelled out on [https://defcon.org/html/defcon-safemode/dc-safemode-plus.html](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-safemode/dc-safemode-plus.html).  
  
Your support makes DEF CON possible, and we appreciate all the encouragement and enthusiasm you’ve brought to this first-time online event. Thanks for sticking with us - we can’t wait until we get to do it again in person. DEF CON hearts you.
