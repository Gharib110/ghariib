[![SCA Is No Longer Relevant: Insights From the Founder of Black Duck](https://www.reversinglabs.com/hubfs/sca-no-longer-relevant.jpg)](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/sca-is-no-longer-relevant)

I founded Black Duck Software in December 2002, and served as its first CEO for many years. Black Duck has long been recognized as a pioneer in open-source compliance and vulnerability management. Since its inception, it has played a pivotal role in shaping the software composition analysis (SCA) industry. My deep history with Black Duck, combined with my early contributions to the SCA space, provides me with a unique perspective on the evolving challenges facing application security (AppSec).
