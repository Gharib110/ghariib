		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Quantum Key-Recovery Attacks on Permutation-Based Pseudorandom Functions</strong><br>
<em>Hong-Wei Sun</em></p>
<p>Due to their simple security assessments, permutation-based pseudo-random functions (PRFs) have become widely used in cryptography. It has been shown that PRFs using a single $n$-bit permutation achieve $n/2$ bits of security, while those using two permutation calls provide $2n/3$ bits of security in the classical setting. This paper studies the security of permutation-based PRFs within the Q1 model, where attackers are restricted to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We present improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs compared with the previous attacks. Specifically, under the same assumptions/hardware as Grover&rsquo;s exhaustive search attack, i.e. the offline Simon algorithm, we can recover keys in quantum time $tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits. Furthermore, we enhance previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, while maintaining the same time complexity. This implies that permutation-based PRFs become vulnerable when adversaries have access to quantum computing resources. It is pointed out that the above quantum attack can be used to quite a few cryptography, including SoEM, PDMMAC, pEDM, as well as general instantiations like XopEM, EDMEM, EDMDEM, and others.</p>

		<p>Business owners and CEOs across the United States received customized ransomware threats this month from the most unusual of places—letters in the mail.</p>
<p>The letters, which were first reported by multiple cybersecurity researchers, claim to come from a ransomware group called BianLian. But since Malwarebytes first started tracking BianLian nearly one year ago, our intelligence analysts have never seen the cybercriminal gang resort to sending physical letters to make their ransom demands, suggesting that the latest snail mail campaign could be the work of copycats.</p>

		<p>In a post on r/RedditSafety by a Reddit administrator, the platform announced that it will start sending warnings to users that upvote violent content.</p>
<p>Reddit is a social media platform and online forum where users can share and discuss content across a wide range of topics. The platform’s structure divides it into communities known as “subreddits,” each focused on a specific subject or interest (from cars to movies to sports to knitting). Users can submit posts, which can be links, text, images, or videos, and other users can vote on these posts using “upvotes” or “downvotes.” The voting system determines the visibility of posts, with highly upvoted content appearing at the top of subreddits and potentially reaching the site’s front page.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Registration-Based Encryption in the Plain Model</strong><br>
<em>Jesko Dujmovic, Giulio Malavolta, Wei Qi</em></p>
<p>Registration-based encryption (RBE) is a recently developed alternative to identity-based encryption, that mitigates the well-known key-escrow problem by letting each user sample its own key pair. In RBE, the key authority is substituted by a key curator, a completely transparent entity whose only job is to reliably aggregate users&rsquo; keys. However, one limitation of all known RBE scheme is that they all rely on one-time trusted setup, that must be computed honestly. In this work, we ask whether this limitation is indeed inherent and we initiate the systematic study of RBE in the plain model, without any common reference string. We present the following main results: - (Definitions) We show that the standard security definition of RBE is unachievable without a trusted setup and we propose a slight weakening, where one honest user is required to be registered in the system. - (Constructions) We present constructions of RBE in the plain model, based on standard cryptographic assumptions. Along the way, we introduce the notions of non-interactive witness indistinguishable (NIWI) proofs secure against chosen statements attack and re-randomizable RBE, which may be of independent interest. A major limitation of our constructions, is that users must be updated upon every new registration. - (Lower Bounds) We show that this limitation is in some sense inherent. We prove that any RBE in the plain model that satisfies a certain structural requirement, which holds for all known RBE constructions, must update all but a vanishing fraction of the users, upon each new registration. This is in contrast with the standard RBE settings, where users receive a logarithmic amount of updates throughout the lifetime of the system.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This month is the five-year anniversary of the COVID-19 lockdowns in California. In March 2020, I was studying abroad in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I had heard rumors about lockdowns in the West, but nothing had changed in Russia. People continued to move about without a mask, and people certainly were not locked down. Life was normal.</p>
<p>Amid the normalcy, I suddenly received a shocking email: my study abroad had been canceled by my university in the United States. They told me that I needed to return home immediately and to “self-isolate” for 14 days after my return. The contrast between the vibrant streets of Saint Petersburg and that email captured the core of the pandemic; the response to COVID-19 was completely subjective, and these subjective preferences were imposed on the general population, depriving people of liberty, autonomy, and freedom of choice.</p>
