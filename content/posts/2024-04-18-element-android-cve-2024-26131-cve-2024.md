# Element Android CVE-2024-26131 CVE-2024-26132 - Never Take Intents From Strangers

<br/>

<br/>
TL;DR
-----

During a security audit of [Element Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app&hl=en&gl=US), the official [Matrix](https://matrix.org) client for Android, we have identified two vulnerabilities in how specially forged intents generated from other apps are handled by the application. As an impact, a malicious application would be able to significatively break the security of the application, with possible impacts ranging from exfiltrating sensitive files via arbitrary chats to fully taking over victimsâ€™ accounts. After private disclosure of the details, the vulnerabilities have been promptly accepted and fixed by the Element Android team.
