# A thought experiment

<br/>

<br/>
I was on LinkedIn this morning and came across this link in the 'Pentesting' group, one of the many groups I have joined there.

It's a series of case studies with a scenario and some questions to be answered in a 5,000 word essay format.

I thought that in the coming episodes of Brakeing Down Security, it might be interesting to spend a little time breaking down one of these case studies, analyze all the info provided, and give our ideas on how we might go about solving the issue or mitigating what has occurred. Then, we could turn our rabid fans loose on the problem and see if we missed anything, or if someone comes up with a better response (highly likely, as we have many intelligent listeners)

Look for this to happen in the next few weeks.
