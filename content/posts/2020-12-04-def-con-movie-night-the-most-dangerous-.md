The Most Dangerous Game' was made in 1932, but you can still hear its echoes in modern cinema. It's a surprisingly tense pre-code thriller about bored rich creeps who hunt humans for sport, and it walked so 'Predator' could run. Good fun, and a subtext that finds its way into movies a lot more often than you think. Watch this space for some more discussion of the film and join us in the DEF CON Discord Server Saturday Night at 8pm PST ([discord.gg/defcon](https://discord.gg/DEFCON/)/) in movie-night-text and movie-night-voice.
