# Data privacy in a consumers world

<br/>

<br/>
Our guest, Mark Kapczynski from OneRep, joins Dave to discuss what consumers should know about data privacy. Listener Jon writes in to the show with some follow-up with some thoughts on tap interface. Another anonymous listener wrote into the show discussing ethical hacking. Dave's story is on fake QR codes and how people are getting scammed out of money after receiving a fake QR code parking ticket survey. Joe's story follows an attempted attack at Dragos and what they didn't get. Our catch of the day comes from listener Richard who writes in with a fun scam he caught from the "Marine Corps." Links to stories: QR codes used in fake parking tickets, surveys to steal your money Deconstructing a Cybersecurity Event Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
