# 2017-039-creating custom training for your org and audio from SANS Berlin

<br/>

<br/>
This week is a bit of a short show, as Ms. Berlin and Mr. Boettcher are out this week for the holiday.  

I wanted to talk about something that I've started doing at work... Creating training... custom training that can help your org get around the old style training.

Also, we got some community audio from one of our listeners! "JB" went to a SANS event in Berlin, Germany a few weeks ago, and talked to some attendees, as well as Heather Mahalick (@HeatherMahalik), instructor of the FOR585 FOR585: Advanced Smartphone Forensics"

Take a listen and we hope you enjoy it!

What makes us despise training so much?

Cookie cutter

Speaking is a little too perfect

Flash based

UI is horrible

Outdated

Easy questions

Infosec training is worse

2 hours of training each year

Not effective

Why not make your own?

Been doing it at work

No more than 7 minutes

Custom made

Tailored for your own company

Do you training like a talk at a con

Time limit: 7 (no more than 10 minutes)

Create some slides (5-7 slides)

Do it on a timely topic

Recent tabletop exercise results

Recent incident response

Phishing campaign

Script or no-script required

Sometimes talking plainly can be enough
