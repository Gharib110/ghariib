# Acceleration of our digital lives and impacts on cybercrime

<br/>

<br/>
Guest Darren Shou, Chief Technology Officer of NortonLifeLock, shares insight on some of the scams he and his colleagues have been tracking, Joe and Dave share some follow up from listener Robert about free learning resources, Joe's story comes from listener Sedric who is new to real estate Investing and was looking for a hard money loan, rather than a story, Dave continues the conversation on passwords and multi-factor authentication with comments from listener Coinsigliere, and our Catch of the Day, well "catches" of the day since we have two, include one from Pryce on a smishing scam and the second from Ronald with a subscription email scam.. Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share? Email it to us at hackinghumans@thecyberwire.com or hit us up on Twitter.
