# DeepINTEL 2024 a full Day all about Security Intelligence

<br/>

<br/>
The DeepINTEL 2024 security intelligence has begun. The day holds a full day of presentation about current and future threats. It is difficult to describe a TLP:AMBER event, because we do not publish the schedule for DeepINTEL. The term security intelligence has a wide spectrum. Basically, it includes all informations that will help you improve your defence, understand your adversaries, and how attacking groups operate. The sources are probes, monitoring systems, reports from attacks and their analysis. We are looking forward to provide the next iteration of DeepINTEL as a unique forum where security experts can get crucial updates. Grab your coffee, listen, and contribute!
