# All About Tor

<br/>

<br/>
Brakeing Down Security tackles the 'Deep Web' this week... yep, we talk about Tor. If you don't have a lot of experience with this or wonder how it works, we give you a little history and help you understand the traffic flow works.

We even give you some advice on de-identification and things you shouldn't allow when traveling the Deep Web, like Javascript, Flash, and Java.
