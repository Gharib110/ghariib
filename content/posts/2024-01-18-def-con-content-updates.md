# DEF CON Content Updates

We’ve got some DEF CON content updates for you today!  
  
First, we’ve added some AppSec Village videos we were missing from DC30 and DC31. You can grab them at [media.defcon.org](https://media.defcon.org).  
  
Second, the big torrent of all the goodies from DC31 is now also live on the [media server](https://media.defcon.org).  
  
And third, if you’re looking for a 1.7T ‘everything DC’ torrent, that’s freshly updated and available for you on [infocon.org](https://infocon.org).  
  
Make sure to stretch your coaxials before attempting that last one. Safety first.
