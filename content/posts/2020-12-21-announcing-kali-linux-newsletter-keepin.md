# Announcing Kali Linux Newsletter Keeping in Touch

Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Today we are announcing the Kali Linux newsletter.

It’s easy to miss certain news. Not everyone is regularly checking our web page to see if something has been posted _(and we don’t have a regular schedule of when we update)_. It is easy to be drowned out in social networks with everything else going on. And RSS feeds have not been as common as they once were. So to try and help keep you in the loop with Kali Linux, we now have a newsletter option.

The contents of the newsletter will mirror [our blog posts](https://www.kali.org/blog/) _(we are not trying to market or sell anything to you)_. Once a day, if there has been any new posts, we will now send a copy direct to your inbox.

If you want to, please sign up to the [Kali Linux newsletter](https://www.kali.org/newsletter/).

Stay tuned, as we are going to keep working on other ways to improve our communication and community interaction in 2021!
