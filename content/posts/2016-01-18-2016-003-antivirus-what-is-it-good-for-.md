# 2016-003-Antivirus what is it good for absolutely nothing

<br/>

<br/>
#Anti-virus products... they have been around for as long as many of us have been alive. The first anti-virus program, "The Reaper" was designed to get rid of the first virus 'The Creeper' by Ray Tomlinson in 1971.

This week, we discuss the efficacy of anti-virus. Is it still needed? What should blue teamers be looking for to make their anti-virus work for them.  And what options do you have if you don't want to use anti-virus?

We also argue about whether it's just a huge industry selling snake oil that is bolstered by #compliance #frameworks, like #PCI?
