# LDAPSearch Reference

<br/>

<br/>
ldapsearch is a extremely powerful tool, especially for Windows Active Directory enumeration. It’s one of my primary tools when performing pentesting or red teaming against an environment with Active Directory, but also comes in quiet handy to know as many times it can come default installed or part of a base image, so its a bit Living-Off-The-Land-esq. Another point towards ldapsearch is that it’s easy to forget that Active Directory isn’t the only LDAP server in most environments and the ability to utilize a tool like this can come in extremely handy.
