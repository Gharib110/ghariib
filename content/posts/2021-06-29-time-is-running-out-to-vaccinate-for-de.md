# Time is Running Out to Vaccinate for DEF CON 29

Friendly reminder - if you’re planning to get vaccinated in order to join us for DEF CON 29 in Vegas, there’s only about 5 weeks left until the con. You need about that long from the first shot for the full effect (depending on vendor, of course) so you should get things started.
