# 1-click RCE on Keybase

<br/>

<br/>
### TL;DR

[Keybase clients](https://keybase.io/download) allowed to send links in chats with arbitrary schemes and arbitrary display text. On Windows it was possible to send an apparently harmless link which, when clicked, could execute arbitrary commands on the victimâ€™s system.

Introduction
------------

[Keybase](https://keybase.io/) is a chat, file sharing, git, \* platform, similar to [Slack](https://slack.com/), but with a security in-depth approach. \*Everything\* on Keybase is encrypted, allowing you to relax while syncing your private files on the cloud.
