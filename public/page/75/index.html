<p>So far, 20 pipo don share ova $4m in rewards afta dem find $40m of di stolen money and call di crypto companies make dem block di transfer.</p>
<p>But sabi pipo no dey optimistic again say dem go fit recover di rest of di money becos of di North Korean knowledge for hacking and laundering of di money.</p>
<p>Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point tok say, “North Korea na veri closed system and closed economy so dem don create successful industry of hacking and laundering and dem no care about di negative impression of cyber crime”</p>

<p>Frankly, most AI tools that students swear by aren’t all that great. Half the time, they generate inaccurate information, give incorrect answers, or overcomplicate things for no reason. NotebookLM doesn’t do any of that.</p>

<p>Law enforcement and digital forensic specialists have long utilized GPUs for password recovery. GPUs excel at this task due to their thousands of parallel processing cores, enabling rapid hash computations. Tools like Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery leverage GPU acceleration to significantly outperform traditional CPUs in brute-force attacks. The new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture doubles the number of INT32 compute units compared to Ada and Ampere. How will this architectural change affect password recovery, and is it worth upgrading to a new GPU?</p>

<p>Just a week ago, we published an article about NVIDIA’s new generation of Blackwell-based graphics cards. Despite a noticeable price hike, performance gains in this generation are minimal, with one notable exception: the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 significantly outperforms its predecessor in all key aspects. However, this GPU has also revealed a potential issue that could make its use in workstations running 24/7 problematic and potentially unsafe.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-connector">The New Connector</h2>
<p>Before diving into the root of the issue, let’s first understand how it arose. Modern GPUs require far more power than what can be delivered through the PCIe slot alone, forcing manufacturers to provide additional power via cables directly from the PSU. Antec, a well-known PSU manufacturer, has published a diagram illustrating the number of cables required to power high-performance graphics cards.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the Estonian Internet Voting System, IVXV, SoK and Suggestions</strong><br>
<em>Shymaa M. Arafat</em></p>
<p>The Estonian i-voting experience is probably the richest to analyze; a country that is considered a pioneer in digitizing both the government and private sector since 2001, and hence digital voting in 2005, yet there are still some complaints submitted, critics and remarks to consider about the IVXV system. In this paper, we introduce a Systemization of Knowledge of the Estonian IVXV i-voting system and propose some added security enhancements. The presented SoK includes applications implemented by election observers in 2023 &amp; 2024 elections, which, to our knowledge, has never been mentioned and/or analyzed in the academic literature before. The paper also updates the general knowledge about an extra right given to auditors (but not observers) in the June 2024 European election, recent complaints, and about newer solutions suggested by academia in 2024. Finally, we discuss the current system status in 2024 EP elections and propose our own suggestions to some problems stated in the OSCE-ODIHR 2023 report that are still there.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, companies are managing an increasingly complex mix of environments — from SaaS applications and public cloud platforms to on-prem data centers and hybrid setups. This diverse infrastructure offers flexibility and scalability, but also opens up new attack surfaces.</p>
<p>To support both business continuity and security needs, “security must evolve from being reactive to predictive”. Maintaining a healthy security posture entails monitoring and strengthening your security defenses to identify risks, ensure compliance, and protect against evolving threats. With our newest capabilities, you can now use Cloudflare to achieve a healthy posture across your SaaS and web applications. This addresses any security team’s ultimate (daily) question: <em>How well are our assets and documents protected</em>?</p>

<p>As we see a steady stream of headlines daily about new threat actors, attack vectors, and evolving risks, it’s clear that the cybersecurity market is undergoing rapid and constant change. Staying ahead of these challenges is no longer optional—it’s essential to protect organizations from emerging threats.</p>

<p>According to ESET APT Activity Report Q2 2024-Q3 2024, China-linked threat groups dominate global APT campaigns, with MustangPanda responsible for 12% of activity during the observed quarters of 2024. Another nefarious China-backed APT group tracked as MirrorFace (aka Earth Kasha) has been observed expanding its geographical reach to target the diplomatic agency in the EU using ANEL backdoor. The offensive adversary campaign, which was uncovered in the late summer of 2024, came into the spotlight known as the AkaiRyū operation (Japanese for RedDragon).</p>
