# Deviant Does Devices at DEF CON

DEF CON 31 is officially a month away! This means we’re going to see some evergreen social media posts come back around, like:  
  
DEF CON is cancelled (it’s not)  
  
DEF CON is coming and I’m not ready (deep breaths, you’ll be fine)  
  
DEF CON will cast your precious devices into The Further so only bring an abacus and semaphores (hasn’t been the case for a long time - take some reasonable precautions and pack as heavy as you like)  
  
To further explain this last issue, physical security superhero and Friend of the Con [Deviant has produced a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsPeB6bc5ho). These opinions are his, of course, but they’re also pretty smart. See you soon!
