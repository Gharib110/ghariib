# It all goes in the cloud Part 1

<br/>

<br/>
Brian and I interviewed Mr. Guillaume Ross (@gepeto42), an Information Security professional who helps organizations get themselves situated into cloud based solutions. We get a better understanding of why people would want to put their info into the 'cloud' and how they are different than traditional co-lo and datacenters.
