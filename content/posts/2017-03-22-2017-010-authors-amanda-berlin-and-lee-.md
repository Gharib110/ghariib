# 2017-010-Authors Amanda Berlin and Lee Brotherston of the Defensive Security Handbook

<br/>

<br/>
Our very own Ms. Berlin and Mr. Lee Brotherston ([@synackpse](https://twitter.com/synackpse)), veteran of the show, co-authored an #O'Reilly book called the "Defensive Security Handbook"

We talk with Amanda and Lee (or Lee and Amanda :D ) about why they wrote the book, how people should use the book, and how you can maximize your company's resources to protect you.

The best thing is that you can pick up the ebook right now! It's available for pre-order on Safari books ([Link](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/defensive-security-handbook/9781491960370/)), or pre-order on Amazon.com ([Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491960388/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1491960388&linkCode=as2&tag=bdspod-20&linkId=536ce672c331df3ecf03919acc472ce3))
