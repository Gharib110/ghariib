# 2017-009-Dave Kennedy talks about CIAs Vault7 ISC2 and Derbycon updates

<br/>

<br/>
Wikileaks published a cache of documents and information from what appears to be a wiki from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

This week, we discuss the details of the leak (as of 11Mar 2017), and how damaging it is to blue teamers.

To help us, we asked Mr. Dave Kennedy  (@hackingDave) to sit down with us and discuss what he found, and his opinions of the data that was leaked. Mr. Kennedy is always a great interview, and his insights are now regularly seen on Fox Business News, CNN, and MSNBC.

Dave isn't one to rest on his laurels. For many of you, you know him as the co-organizer of #derbycon, as well as a board member of #ISC2.  We ask him about initiatives going on with ISC2, and how you (whether or not you're a ISC2 cert holder). You can help with various committees and helping to improve the certification landscape. We talk about how to get involved.

We finish up asking about the latest updates to DerbyCon, as well as the dates of tickets, and we talk about our CTF for a free ticket to DerbyCon.

**WL: “CIA ‘hoarded’ vulnerabilities or ‘cyber-weapons’**

    **Should they not have tools that allow them to infiltrate systems of ‘bad’ people?**

    **Promises to share information with manufacturers**

        **BrBr- Manufacturers and devs are the reason the CIA has ‘cyber-weapons’**

            **Shit code, poor software design/architecture**

            **Security wonks aren’t without blame here either**

[**http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39218393**](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39218393)  **-RAND report**

        **Report suggested stockpiling is ‘good’**

            **“On the other hand, publicly disclosing a vulnerability that isn't known by one's adversaries gives them the upper hand, because the adversary could then protect against any attack using that vulnerability, while still keeping an inventory of vulnerabilities of which only it is aware of in reserve.”**

Encryption does still work, in many cases… as it appears they are having to intercept the data before it makes it into secure messaging systems…

(somewhat relevant? Not sure if you want to touch on [https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/837846963471122432/photo/1](https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/837846963471122432/photo/1))

Wikileaks - more harm than good?

    Guess that depends on what side you’re on

    What side is Assange on? (his own side?)

    Media creates FUD because they don’t understand

        Secure messaging apps busted (fud inferred by WL)

            In fact, data is circumvented before encryption is applied.

Some of the docs make you wonder about the need for ‘over-classification’

  

Vulnerabilities uncovered

Samsung Smart TVs “Fake-Off”

Tools to exfil data off of iDevices

    BrBr- Cellbrite has sold that for years to the FBI

        CIA appears to only have up to iOS 9 (according to docs released)

Car hacking tech

Sandbox detection (notices mouse clicks or the lack of them)

    Reported by eEye: [https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page\_2621847.html](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_2621847.html)

\*\*anything Mr. Kennedy feels is important to mention\*\*

**What can blue teamers do to protect themselves?**

    **Take an accounting of ‘smart devices’ in your workplace**

        **Educate users on not bringing smart devices to work**

            **And at home (if they are remote)**

                **Alexa,**

        **Restrict smart devices in sensitive areas**

            **SCIFs, conference rooms, even in ‘open workplace’ areas**

    **Segment possibly affected systems from the internet**

    **Keep proper inventories of software used in your environment**

    **Modify IR exercises to allow for this type of scenario?**

    **Reduce ‘smart’ devices**

        **Grab that drill and modify the TV in the conference room**

        **Cover the cameras on TV**

            **Is that too paranoid?**

        **Don’t setup networking on smart devices or use cloud services on ‘smart’ devices**

    **Remind devs that unpatched or crap code can become the next ‘cyber-weapon’ ;)**
