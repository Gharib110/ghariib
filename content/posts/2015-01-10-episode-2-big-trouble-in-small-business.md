# Episode 2 Big Trouble in Small Businesses

<br/>

<br/>
Security's the same, the world around...  and is a necessity in businesses of all sizes, from the mega-corporations, all the way down to the business with 10 employees in a garage in suburbia.

This week, Mr. Boettcher and I discuss security in small businesses. What is needed to make security part of the culture of a new company. We discuss some open source tools to ensure that networks are monitored properly, logs are collected, collated, and analyzed. And better yet, these are on the cheap, which is helpful for a small business on a tight budget.
