The DEF CON Discord is open ([discord.gg/defcon](https://discord.gg/defcon)). You can hang out in virtual LineCon, try out the offerings of one of our hybrid villages and meet DEF CON family from around the world.  
  
The DEF CON Groups have a VR hangout going on throughout DEF CON. Learn what DCGs across the globe are up to, maybe even find a group near you to join so you can keep that DEF CON vibe all year! The info you need to get involved is here: [https://www.dcgvr.org/DEF\_CON\_Groups\_AltspaceVR\_-\_Quick Guide\_v1.6.pdf](https://www.dcgvr.org/DEF_CON_Groups_AltspaceVR_-_Quick Guide_v1.6.pdf) and you can join in on the fun with or without a VR headset. You can even watch the event live on Twitch: [twitch.tv/defcon\_groups](https://twitch.tv/defcon_groups).  
  
Follow our YouTube channel ([DEFCONConference](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference)) for video updates from DC30 all weekend. We’ve upped our content game this year and we’ll be sharing a bunch of interviews and contest content.  
  
So even if you’re not onsite, you can still get some DEF CON into your 2022, and we’ll save you a place in LineCon for 2023.
