# Is Compliance running or ruining Security Programs

<br/>

<br/>
We at Brakeing Down Security world headquarters don't understand the concept of 'End of the Year' podcast, so consider this the "End-End of the Year" podcast.

We talked about the order of things... whether Compliance is a detriment to Security, and who should be running who.

So pull up a glass of eggnog, grabbing another cookie, and put another log on the fire, cause Brakeing Down Security is throwing out one more for the year! Â Happy Holidays... all of them... :)
