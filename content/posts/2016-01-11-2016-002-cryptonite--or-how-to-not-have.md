# 2016-002-Cryptonite- or how to not have your apps turn to crap

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we find ourselves understanding the #Cryptonite that can weaken devs and software creators when dealing with #cryptographic #algorithms and #passwords. Lack of proper crypto controls and hardcoded passwords can quickly turn your app into crap.

Remember the last time you heard about a hardcoded #SSH private key, or have you been at work when a developer left the #API keys in his #github #repo?

We go through some gotchas from the excellent book "24 Deadly Sins of Software Security". Anyone doing a threat analysis, or code audit needs to check for these things to ensure you don't end up in the news with a hardcoded password in your home router firmware, like these guys: [https://securityledger.com/2015/08/hardcoded-firmware-password-sinks-home-routers/](https://securityledger.com/2015/08/hardcoded-firmware-password-sinks-home-routers/)
