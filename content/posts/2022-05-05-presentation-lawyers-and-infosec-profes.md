# Presentation Lawyers and InfoSec professionals - playing nicely with lawyers to provide more value in your engagements

<br/>

<br/>
I was very kindly invited back to give a keynote at the [Canadian Cyber Summit](https://members.htcia.org/events/Details/2022-htcia-canada-cyber-summit-407535?sourceTypeId=Website) for the [High Technology Crime Investigation Association](https://htcia.org). I spoke about the role of lawyers in incident response and how greater understanding between lawyers and the technical folks of their respective roles can add value to the overall engagement. I also discussed the importance of legal advice privilege in indicent response. Here is a copy of the [presentation I gave](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Qs66lis-oo3I-TH0UZVTRJTftKnBSiC/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109239855867197881918&rtpof=true&sd=true), in case it's of interest ...
