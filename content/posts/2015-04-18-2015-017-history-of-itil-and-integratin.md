# 2015-017 History of ITIL and integrating Security

<br/>

<br/>
Much of InfoSec and Compliance is all about processes, procedures, controls, audits, and the proper management of all of these.  To do so, you need a proper framework to make these as seamless as possible. ITIL is one of these types of frameworks.

We introduce Mr. Tim Wood on the podcast, who has over 20 years of ITIL experience and began ITIL implementations in banks and Healthcare systems in the United Kingdom. He currently works with different industries to change culture and make an ITIL a reality.

This week, we go over the History of ITIL, and understand the various incarnations from v1.0 to v3.0. You quickly understand where security will start fitting into all those facets of the ITIL framework.
