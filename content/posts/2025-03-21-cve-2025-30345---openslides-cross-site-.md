**CVE ID :** CVE-2025-30345  
**Published :** March 21, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago  
**Description :** An issue was discovered in OpenSlides before 4.2.5. When creating new chats via the chat\_group.create action, the user is able to specify the name of the chat. Some HTML elements such as SCRIPT are filtered, whereas others are not. In most cases, HTML entities are encoded properly, but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This potentially allows attackers to interfere with the layout of the rendered website, but it is unlikely that victims would click on deleted chats or deleted messages.  
**Severity:** 3.5 | LOW
