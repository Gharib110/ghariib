John Nye ([@EndisNye\_com](https://twitter.com/endisnye_com?lang=en)) is the VP of Cybersecurity Strategy at healthcare consultancy #CynergisTek. He's in the process of writing a whitepaper about the issues that are still plaguing healthcare. While every industry in the world has to deal with #security issues, the stakes are highest, and most personal, in healthcare. Because healthcare data is highly sensitive, a breach can cause major problems for the individual and #healthcare organization — in addition to embarrassment and sometimes extortion or blackmail.

We go over some of the things he's found, and discuss how we could address these issues.

Ms. Berlin's course "Disrupting the Kill Chain" is planned to start on the 5th of February, and will be 4 sessions, with new material if you've seen her workshop at previous conferences.  The cost of the class will be $100 USD for access to our Zoom webex. If you'd like to gain access to the videos we'll have for the class, you can buy access to them for $50 USD.
