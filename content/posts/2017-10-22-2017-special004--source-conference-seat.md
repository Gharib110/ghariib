# 2017-SPECIAL004- SOURCE Conference Seattle 2017

<br/>

<br/>
After last year's SOURCE Conference, I knew I needed to go again, not just because it was a local (Seattle) infosec conference, but because of the caliber of speakers and the range of topics that were going to be covered.

I got audio from two of the speakers at the SOURCE conference (@sourceconf) on Twitter

Lee Fisher and Paul English from PreOS Security about UEFI security and methods to secure your devices  [https://preossec.com/](https://preossec.com/)

Joe Basirico discusses the proper environment to get the best out of your bug bounty program. 

points from his abstract:

Bug Bounty Programs - Why you want to invite security researchers to hack your products

Marketing your Security Program - How and why to market your security program. What to say, how to say it, and where to say it for maximum effectiveness.

How to Communicate with Security Researchers - What are security researchers expecting in communication, responsiveness, transparency, and time to fix.
