# Azure CLI code injection vulnerability

<br/>

<br/>
Azure CLI contained a code injection vulnerability that could be exploited in a scenario where the host runs a command where parameter values have been provided by an external untrusted source - these could be specially crafted in such a way as to exploit the vulnerability, leading to remote code execution on the host. The vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run on a Windows machine and with any version of PowerShell and when the parameter value contains the \`&\` or \`|\` symbols.
