The DEF CON 33 Call Season is now almost complete! The Call for Papers is LIVE. We're also ready to accept submissions for Demos, Workshops and Policy. Things are well and truly underway. Time to breathe deep, gather your ideas and get busy proposing.  
  
For the comprehensive list of open calls, visit [the DEF CON 33 Call Index](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-cfi.html). Rules, guidance, deadlines â€“ it's all there.  
  
Participation is the cheat code that unlocks the secret DEF CON levels. We can't wait to see what you've got in mind.
