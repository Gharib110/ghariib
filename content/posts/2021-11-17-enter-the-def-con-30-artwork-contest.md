Now that the DEF CON 30 Theme is out there in the world, it’s time to go pencils up on the DEF CON Art Contest!  
  
[This year’s theme is ‘Hacker Homecoming’](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-news.html#dc30theme), and you can read all about it on the DEF CON Forums. It’s a theme meant to celebrate our community’s much awaited reunion next August. It’s also meant to reference the 30th Anniversary we’re celebrating, which is a pretty big deal for a hacker conference.  
  
So if you’ve got some art skills, you’ve got a luxurious 7+ months to get your take on the theme in to us. There’s so much time between now and the June 1 deadline that you could probably learn a brand new art style in which to make your submission. You can drop as many submissions to **pictures@defcon.org** as you want, so enter early and often.  
  
**\### Theme:**  
  
We are looking for artwork that reflects a spirit of community and reunion. We’re looking for art that combines the 90’s hacker aesthetic of DEF CON’s history and our tribe’s 21st century future. We’re looking for your vision and vibes.  
  
We hope you’ll take in the information in [the style guide](https://defcon.org/images/defcon-30/30theme.webp), but we hope that you’ll use that as a launching pad and not a set of limits. We want to see where you can take these ideas.  
  
**\### Guidelines:**  
  
300 DPI. Convert type to outlines where applicable. Trust your instincts - we’re looking for genuine energy, not technical perfection. We want to share and amplify the artists in our community. If tlhat’s you, get your ideas down. If that’s not you yet, could it be? You’ve got a few months to find out.  
  
Entries will be placed on the DEF CON Forums for voting, and there will be prizes. There will also be gratitude, and opportunities to inspire others with your special way of seeing the world. We can’t wait to see what you’ll make!
