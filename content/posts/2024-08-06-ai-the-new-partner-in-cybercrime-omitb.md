# AI The new partner in cybercrime OMITB

<br/>

<br/>
Welcome in! You’ve entered, Only Malware in the Building. Join us each month to sip tea and solve mysteries about today’s most interesting threats. Your host is Selena Larson, Proofpoint intelligence analyst and host of their podcast DISCARDED. Inspired by the residents of a building in New York’s exclusive upper west side, Selena is joined by N2K Networks Dave Bittner and Rick Howard to uncover the stories behind notable cyberattacks.  Being a security researcher is a bit like being a detective: you gather clues, analyze the evidence, and consult the experts to solve the cyber puzzle. On this episode, we talk about the use of AI in cyberattacks Proofpoint recently released two articles on two cyber campaigns: one by the group UNK\_SweetSpecter targeting U.S. organizations involved in AI with the SugarGh0st RAT, and another by TA547 targeting German organizations with Rhadamanthys malware. Today we look at what the focus of threat actor objectives are and what that means for defenders.
