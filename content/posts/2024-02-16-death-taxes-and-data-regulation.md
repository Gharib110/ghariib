Nate considers the implications of [Ukraine’s “defend forward” cyber strategy](https://therecord.media/ukraine-cyberattacks-aiding-ground-war-russia?utm_source=pocket_reader) in its war against Russia.

In this week’s quick hits, Gus and Jane reflect on the [FCC’s ban on AI-generated voice cloning in robocalls](https://therecord.media/ai-voice-cloning-robocalls-banned-fcc), Nate touches on an [alert from CISA and FBI on the threat presented by Chinese hackers to critical infrastructure](https://therecord.media/cisa-fbi-warn-of-china-linked-hackers-targeting-critical-us-infrastructure?utm_source=pocket_saves), Gus comments on [South Korea’s pause on implementation of its anti-monopoly platform act](https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2024/02/08/A4U4X6TWEFFOXF7ITCS5K6SZN4/) and [the apparent futility of nudges](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj5778) (with respect to climate change attitudes or otherwise), and finally Brian closes with a few words on [possible broad U.S. import restrictions on Chinese EVs](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/02/09/biden-administration-restrict-imports-chinese-evs-parts-built/) and how even the [abundance of mediocre AI-related ads](https://www.cnet.com/tech/ai-scores-in-super-bowl-commercials-you-can-watch-them-here/) couldn’t ruin Taylor Swift’s Super Bowl.
