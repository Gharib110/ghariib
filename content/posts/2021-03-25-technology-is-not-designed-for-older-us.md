# Technology is not designed for older users

<br/>

<br/>
Guest Ming Yang of Orchard joins Dave to talk about ways to help your parents with technology (aka providing tech support for our parents). Dave shares the FBI's advisory warning of an expected increase in the use of deepfakes for social engineering attacks, Joe's got a story about phantom debts, and our Catch of the Day is from a listener named Anthony about an email from federalcrimeofinvestigation@gmail.com. Hmmm...seems legit. Links to stories: Malicious Actors Almost Certainly Will Leverage Synthetic Content for Cyber and Foreign Influence Operations Beware Scammers Trying to Collect Phantom Debts Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
