	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Amazon has announced its Echo devices will no longer have the option to store and process requests on the device itself, meaning your voice recordings will now be sent to the cloud for processing.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers, Amazon explained that the feature “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” will no longer be available beginning March 28, 2025.</p>
<p>The reason for this change? AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As we continue to expand Alexa’s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.”</p>

<p>Not to be confused with the titular Linux mascot and seabird cousin, the penguin, puffins are another distinctively colorful and whimsical nautical avian. Over the centuries, these beaky birds have been given numerous nicknames and monikers like the “sea parrot” and the harlequinesque appearance of their facial feathers has earned them the distinction of “Clown of the Sea”. </p>
<p>The <em>Fratercula</em> family, to which puffins belong, has Latin roots that pay homage to its namesake’s connection to the clergy. It’s said that the bird’s striking black-and-white plumage was reminiscent of the formal attire worn by friars and monks, lending an air of reverence to this charismatic fowl.</p>

		<p>We were alerted to Mac and Windows stealers currently distributed via Reddit posts targeting users engaging in cryptocurrency trading. One of the common lures is a cracked software version of the popular trading platform TradingView.</p>
<p>The crooks are posting links to both Windows and Mac installers which have been laced with Lumma Stealer and Atomic Stealer (AMOS) respectively.</p>
<p>These two malware families have wreaked havoc, pillaging victims’ personal data and enabling their distributors to make substantial gains, mostly by taking over cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

		<p>Generative AI is reshaping many aspects of our lives, from how we work and learn, to how we play and interact. Given that it&rsquo;s Security Week, it&rsquo;s a good time to think about some of the unintended consequences of this information revolution and the role that we play in bringing them about.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s web is full of AI-generated content: text, code, images, audio, and video can all be generated by machines, normally based on a prompt from a human. Some models have become so sophisticated that distinguishing their artifacts — that is, the text, audio, and video they generate — from everything else can be quite difficult, even for machines themselves. This difficulty creates a number of challenges. On the one hand, those who train and deploy generative AI need to be able to identify AI-created artifacts they scrape from websites in order to avoid polluting their training data. On the other hand, the origin of these artifacts may be intentionally misrepresented, creating myriad problems for society writ large.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Removing 24 malicious apps from the Google Play store and silencing some servers almost halved a botnet known as BadBox.</p>
<p>The BadBox botnet focuses on Android devices, but not just phones. It also affects other devices like TV streaming boxes, tablets, and smart TVs.</p>
<p>The German BSI (Federal Office for Information Security) started the disruption campaign in December by blocking the malware on 30,000 devices. BadBox is referred to as a botnet, because one of its capabilities is to set up the affected device to act as a proxy, allowing other people to use the device’s internet bandwidth and hardware to route their own traffic.</p>

		<p>Google is spying on Android users, starting from even before they have logged in to their Google account.</p>
<p>That’s what researchers from Dublin’s Trinity College found after they conducted a measurement study to investigate the cookies, identifiers and other data stored on Android devices by Google Play Services.</p>
<p>As the company behind the Android Operating System (OS), the Google Play Store, the most popular search engine in the world, and part of the leading company in digital advertising (Alphabet), Google has obtained a position where it would be hard not to profit from.</p>

<p>Willkommen, meine Damen und Herren, zu unserem ersten Wettbewerb in Berlin! That’s correct (if Google translate didn’t steer me wrong). While the Pwn2Own competition started in Vancouver in 2007, we always want to ensure we are reaching the right people with our choice of venue. Over the last few years, the OffensiveCon conference in Berlin has emerged as one of the best offensive-focused events of the year. And while CanSecWest has been a great host over the years, it became apparent that perhaps it was time to relocate our spring event to a new home. With that, we are happy to announce that the enterprise-focused Pwn2Own event will take place on May 15-17, 2025, at the OffensiveCon conference in Berlin, Germany. While this event is currently sold out, we do have tickets available for competitors, and we believe the conference will also open a few more tickets for the public, too. The conference sold out its first run of tickets in under six hours, so it should be a fantastic crowd of some of the best vulnerability researchers in the world.</p>

		<p>Organizations today face an unprecedented challenge – managing complex security operations against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. While internal teams work tirelessly, the sheer scale and complexity of modern threats often exceed their capacity. Advanced security tools are crucial, but they&rsquo;re only part of the solution. What organizations need is a strategic partner, an expert guide to help navigate the intricacies of security operations, identify emerging risks and drive continuous improvement. In this high-stakes environment, success in cybersecurity isn&rsquo;t just about having the right technology; it&rsquo;s about combining tools with expertise to stay ahead of threats and protect critical assets.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In today’s complex cybersecurity landscape, organizations face an evolving array of threats that target the intersection of physical and digital domains. One technology gaining significant adoption in security-conscious environments is the <strong>antivirus kiosk</strong> – a dedicated physical station designed to scan, analyze, and sanitize external media before it connects to an organization’s network infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="the-blind-spot-in-traditional-security"><strong>The Blind Spot in Traditional Security</strong></h2>
<p>Most enterprise security frameworks focus primarily on network-based threats – phishing emails, malicious websites, and direct network intrusions. However, this approach overlooks a critical vulnerability: the physical introduction of digital threats through removable media such as USB drives, external hard disks, and memory cards.</p>

<p>From enhanced table support in the rich-text editor to better piece management, this release brings several quality-of-life improvements for both developers and content managers.</p>
<h2 id="rich-text-improvements">Rich Text Improvements</h2>
<p>The heart of content creation in Apostrophe has always been our rich text editor, and with this release, it becomes even more powerful. We&rsquo;ve added the ability to generate tables from imported CSV files directly within the rich text widget. This allows content editors to quickly transform spreadsheet data into well-formatted web content.</p>
