# 2015-049-Can you achieve Security Through Obscurity

<br/>

<br/>
That's the question many think is an automatic 'yes'.  Whether your Httpd is running on port 82, or maybe your fancy #wordpress #module needs some cover because the code quality is just a little lower than where it should be, and you need to cover up some cruft

This week, Mr. Boettcher and I discuss reasons for obscuring for the sake of #security, when it's a good idea, and when you shouldn't #obscure anything (hint: using #ROT-14, for example)

#encryption #infosec
