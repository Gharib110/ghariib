# Falling for a phishing kit scam

<br/>

<br/>
Larry Cashdollar from Akamai sits down with Dave to discuss their research, "The Kit That Wants It All: Scam Mimics PayPalâ€™s Known Security Measures." Joe shares an incredible story regarding impersonation and man sharing his first hand experience with impostors impersonating him to get a job, luckily a good samaritan shared this information before the damage could be done. Dave's story follows raids happening in Cambodia with connection to alleged cyberscam compounds. We have two catches of the day this week, one is from listener Eric who sends in a romance scam email asking for love from one desperate scammer. The next one comes from Uberfacts on Twitter and is an instagram DM from someone pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II. Links to stories: Someone is pretending to be me. Authorities Raid Alleged Cyberscam Compounds in Cambodia Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share? Email it to us at hackinghumans@thecyberwire.com or hit us up on Twitter.
