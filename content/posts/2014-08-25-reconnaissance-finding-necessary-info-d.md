# Reconnaissance Finding necessary info during a pentest

<br/>

<br/>
I had a healthy debate with Mr. Boettcher this week about the merits of doing recon for a pentest. Mr. Boettcher is a heavy duty proponent of it, and I see it as a necessary evil, but not one that I consider important.  We hash it out, and find some common ground this week.
