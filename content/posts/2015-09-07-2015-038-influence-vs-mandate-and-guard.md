# 2015-038-Influence Vs Mandate and Guardrails vs Speedbumps

<br/>

<br/>
When we wanted to have Martin Fisher on, it was to discuss 'Security Mandate vs. Security Influence'. We wanted to discuss why companies treat compliance as more important, and if it's only because business requires it to be done. And if infosec is a red headed stepchild because they often don't have the guidance of a compliance framework.

But it ended up going in another direction, with Martin discussing infosec leadership, and how we as agents of infosec should be 'guardrails' instead of 'speed bumps' to business processes and people. It was a great discussion from a veteran healthcare CISO, especially if you're thinking of pursuing a CISO or CSO management track.
