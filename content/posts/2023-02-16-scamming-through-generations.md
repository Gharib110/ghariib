# Scamming through generations

<br/>

<br/>
Mathieu Gorge from VigiTrust sits down to discuss the different ways that online attackers target younger and older generations, and what the cybersecurity industry can and should do to protect them. Dave and Joe share some listener follow up from Greg who writes in regarding porch pirates possibly finding a new way to steal packages. In Joe's story this week, we learn that while ransomware was down last year, more and more people are clicking on phishing emails. Dave's story follows Ahad Shams, the co-founder of Web3 metaverse gaming engine startup Webaverse, who ended up getting $4 million of his cryptocurrency stolen. Our catch of the day comes from listener Rodney who writes in about an email he received. The scammers were trying to collect information from him after saying he was already scammed out of money, when in fact he was not.
