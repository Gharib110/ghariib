DEF CON is primarily a cash-at-the-door kind of conference. LineCon is in our DNA, and we will always honor it. Long may the beach balls fly.

Still, the option to register online has been a benefit to many attendees. We’re keeping that method open for all those who need it.

If that’s you, good news! From right now until July 5, 2024, you can register for DC32 at [shop.defcon.org](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center).
