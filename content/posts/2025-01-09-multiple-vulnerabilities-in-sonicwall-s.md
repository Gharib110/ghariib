# Multiple vulnerabilities in SonicWall SonicOS could allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication

<br/>

<br/>
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SonicWall SonicOS that could allow for authentication bypass. SonicOS is SonicWall’s operating system designed for their firewalls and other security devices. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for authentication bypass on the affected system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then; view, change, or delete data.
