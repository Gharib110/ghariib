PAN-OS CVE 2020-2021 - 

We have been made aware of a serious issue with SAML on Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS

We strongly encourage our customers to upgrade to one of the following versions :

PAN-OS 8.1.15

PAN-OS 9.0.9

PAN-OS 9.1.3 and greater

This is a critical vulnerability with the only mitigation being to either turn OFF SAML or to upgrade the PAN-OS.

A CVE will be released on Monday ::  CVE-2020-2021
