Luminous humans of #DEFCON, #SafeMode is now in the books. The time to celebrate the many [Contest Winners](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-safemode/dc-safemode-contest-results.html) is at hand. We also celebrate everyone who competed - just the tiniest bit less, to keep everybody motivated. Congratulations to those who found glory. Encouragement and gratitude to those who didnâ€™t this time. The real victory is the friends we made along the way, who were inside our hearts all along.
