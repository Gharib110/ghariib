Hey, guess what? Pre-registration is all closed up, so if you wanna join in the fun, you gotta get yourself a badge in person. And hey, it's gonna cost you $440 USD cash only, so no credit cards or anything fancy like that. You can find the registration spot at Caesars Forum ([check out maps here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-venue.html). Registration opens around 7 am on Thursday, August 10th, so set your alarm!  
  
Now, here's the deal - there are gonna be two lines when you get there. One for the folks who pre-registered (lucky them!) and one for the ones who didn't. But no worries, our convention is big enough to handle everyone, so even if we run out of our super cool limited edition badges, we've got backup badges that'll get you into all the action.  
  
Once you've got your badge, you can download a DIY receipt from our website or from media.defcon.org when the conference starts. That's your proof of purchase, so no need for cash receipts. See you there!
