# RCE vulnerability in Azure Pipelines

<br/>

<br/>
Legit Security found an RCE vulnerability in Azure Pipelines that could have allowed an attacker to gain complete control of variables and tasks by exploiting logging commands. This would have enabled them to execute malicious code in a context of a pipeline workflow, which would have granted them access to sensitive secrets such as cloud deployment keys, move laterally in the organization, and potentially initiate supply chain attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have needed permissions to create a pull request or push a commit in a repo integrated with Pipelines.
