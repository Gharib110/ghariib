**Vulnerability scanning** is a crucial phase of a penetration test and having an updated vulnerability scanner in your security toolkit can often make a real difference by helping you discover overlooked vulnerable items. For this reason, we’ve manually packaged the latest and newly released [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/) 8.0 tool and libraries for Kali Linux. Although nothing major has changed in this release in terms of running the vulnerability scanner, we wanted to give a quick overview on how to get it up and running.

Setting up Kali for Vulnerability Scanning
------------------------------------------

If you haven’t already, make sure your Kali is up-to-date and install the latest OpenVAS. Once done, run the **openvas-setup** command to setup OpenVAS, download the latest rules, create an admin user, and start up the various services. Depending on your bandwidth and computer resources, this could take a while:

```console
root@kali:~# apt-get update
root@kali:~# apt-get dist-upgrade
root@kali:~# apt-get install openvas
root@kali:~# openvas-setup
/var/lib/openvas/private/CA created
/var/lib/openvas/CA created

Restarting Greenbone Security Assistant: gsad.
User created with password '6062d074-0a4c-4de1-a26a-5f9f055b7c88'.
```

Once **openvas-setup** completes its process, the OpenVAS manager, scanner, and GSAD services should be listening:

```console
root@kali:~# netstat -antp
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:9390 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 9583/openvasmd
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:9391 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 9570/openvassd: Wai
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:9392 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 9596/gsad
```

### Starting the OpenVAS services

If you have already configured OpenVAS, you can simply start all the necessary services by running **openvas-start**:

```console
root@kali:~# openvas-start
Starting OpenVas Services
Starting Greenbone Security Assistant: gsad.
Starting OpenVAS Scanner: openvassd.
Starting OpenVAS Manager: openvasmd.
```

_If you need to troubleshoot any issues, you can use **openvas-check-setup** to identity the problem._

### Connecting to the OpenVAS Web Interface

Point your browser to **https://127.0.0.1:9392**, accept the self signed SSL certificate and plugin the credentials for the **admin** user. The admin password was generated during the setup phase (look at the output above if you missed it).

That’s it! Now OpenVAS is ready for you to configure it and run a scan against a given IP or range. Happy vulnerability scanning!
