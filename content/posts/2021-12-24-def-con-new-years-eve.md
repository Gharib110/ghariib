DEF CON is doing a small [New Year's Eve event](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-nye-2022/dc-nye-2022-index.html) on the DEF CON discord. There will be several hangouts and contests to participate in. We’ll have music, a Kubernetes CTF, A Ham radio CTF, some Hacker Karaoke, movie watchalongs and more. We’ll have the full rundown on defcon.org and we’ll update in the NYE Forum threads. Join us in welcoming 2022 - can't wait to see you!
