<br/>

<br/>
Guest Chris Sherwood, owner of Crosstalk Solutions, joins Dave to talk about passkeys. Joe shares some listener follow-up about "revert" and side-loading applications on Android phones. Joe's story came from a listener named Kyle who sent this as a Catch of the Day (COTD) about a phishing scam email conversation about event sponsorship. Dave discusses something he saw on Mastodon from user Bjorn about some fraudulent bank charges and stopping a scam in process. Our COTD is from listener Alec about a potential dating scam offering over Instagram. Links to follow-up and stories: Follow-up on side-loading applications (Note, we do not recommend you install any of these applications.) Mastodon thread about social engineering involving fraudulent banking charges.
