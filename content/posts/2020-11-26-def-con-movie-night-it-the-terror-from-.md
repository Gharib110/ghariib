This week, we are going to continue the simul-tubing experiment with 'IT! The Terror from Beyond Space" - a solid sci-fi thriller from 1958 that's one of the main inspirations for 'Alien'.  
  
In case it isn't readable, that movie poster promises $50,000 to anyone who can prove the creature from the movie is NOT on Mars. You gotta respect a film that stands behind its premise.  
  
Please join us November 28, 8PM PST in the DEF CON Discord ([discord.gg/defcon/](https://discord.gg/DEFCON/)) in movie-night-text.
