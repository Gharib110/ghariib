DEF CON 29 approaches. It looms. Darn near impends. Be still, and you can hear it – the [DEF CON Call for Everything](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-29/dc-29-cfe.html) ringing though the air.

The CfE is when DEF CON throws open the doors and invites everyone’s best proposals in for a visit. Speaking proposals, ideas for vilages, prospective demo labs, contests, trainings, music, art - literally everything. You write up all the delightful things you want to share with the community, and we find a way to bring the best of them to life at DEF CON.

The Call for Everything page lists all the ways you can participate in the creation of the next DEF CON, along with the relevant details and deadlines, including some new questions intended to get your thoughts on whether this year’s con should be in-person, online or some of both.

So visit the CfE page, read the guidelines, and get your best ideas together. Let’s DO this thing!
