# CVE-2020-27388 YOURLS 15 - 1710 Multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting XSS Vulnerabilities in Admin Panel

<br/>

<br/>
Potential Abuse on a hooked Function There is a potential for abuse with any plugins that implement the hook function ‘shunt\_is\_valid\_user’. In the code below we simply demonstrate that authentication can be completely bypassed by returning TRUE in the hooked function. This would be an ideal place for a stealthy backdoor or any other malicious code. It should be noted that this itself is not a vulnerability, but has a potential to be misused and plugins that use this hook should be checked.
