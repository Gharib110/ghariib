# Chronicle cross-customer bucket access

<br/>

<br/>
Customers can configure Chronicle to ingest data from customer-owned Cloud Storage buckets using an ingestion feed. Chronicle previously used a shared service account for all customers for granting permission to the bucket. Therefore, one customer's Chronicle instance could be configured to ingest data from another customer's Cloud Storage bucket. However, this required knowledge of the bucket URI.
