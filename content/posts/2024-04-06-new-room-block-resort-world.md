Spring has sprung. That means laughter in the air, flowers everywhere, and DEF CON right around the corner. In the spirit of new growth we’ve got another discounted room block for DEF CON 32 attendees - this time it’s at Resorts World. You can check the selection and [book at this link](https://book.passkey.com/e/50812150).  
  
Resorts World is the very large, very new hotel-casino complex that sits on the lot once occupied by The Stardust. It sports a location convenient to the LVCC, the very latest in accommodations and (so far as we can tell) no relation to Michael Crichton’s WestWorld and FutureWorld.  
  
It’s all happening, people. Just a few more months till the big event. Prepare accordingly.
