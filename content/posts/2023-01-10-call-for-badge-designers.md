Have you ever wanted to design a DEF CON Badge? This might be your moment. The [DEF CON 31 call for Badge Designers](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfbd.html) is open. It’s a non-electronic badge year, so we’re looking for some creative analog badge goodness from the community.  
  
Badges take some time to go from concept to lanyard, so if you have a proposal, get it over here! We can’t wait to see what you come up with!
