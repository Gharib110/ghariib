DEF CON Safe Mode Reminder:  
  
We’re keeping [a calendar over on the DEF CON Forums](https://forum.defcon.org/calendar) with all the deadlines for content. As a bunch of these deadlines are imminent, it’s worth throwing a bookmark down on it. While you’re there you can also get involved in all sorts of planning discussions - your help and feedback are a big part of making this happen. Don’t miss the opportunity to help shape DEF CON Safe Mode.
