# New Report Reveals Hidden Risks How Internet-Exposed Systems Threaten Critical Infrastructure





A new Censys report found 145,000 exposed ICSs and thousands of insecure human-machine interfaces (HMIs), providing attackers with an accessible path to disrupt critical operations. Real-world examples underscore the danger, with Iranian and Russian-backed hackers exploiting HMIs to manipulate water systems in Pennsylvania and Texas. GreyNoise research further highlights the

A new Censys report found 145,000 exposed ICSs and thousands of insecure human-machine interfaces (HMIs), providing attackers with an accessible path to disrupt critical operations. Real-world examples underscore the danger, with Iranian and Russian-backed hackers exploiting HMIs to manipulate water systems in Pennsylvania and Texas. GreyNoise research further highlights the urgency: attackers are actively scanning for HMIs and prioritizing Remote Access Services (RAS) over complex ICS protocols, making these easily accessible entry points prime targets for exploitation.
