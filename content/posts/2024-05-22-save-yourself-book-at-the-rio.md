# Save yourself Book at The RIO

DEF CON 32 #protip: On the desert planet of Las Vegas, door to door AC is worth its weight in water.  
  
When choosing a hotel, don’t overlook our deeply discounted room block in the Rio. All our reserved Rio rooms are fully remodeled suites, and there’s a FREE shuttle right to DEF CON’s main entrance. No wasting your precious moisture on the burning sidewalks.  
  
Also, we have it on good authority the the shuttle moves without rhythm so as not to attract the worm.
