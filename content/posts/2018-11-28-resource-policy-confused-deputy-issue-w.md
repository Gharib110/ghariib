# Resource policy confused deputy issue with services

<br/>

<br/>
Resource policies lacked a way of restricting service access to only your own account, allowing an attacker to leverage a service to potentially access your resources. Originally discovered by Dan Peebles and presented at re:Invent in 2018, this issue did not gain enough attention to be fixed until Shir Tamari and Ami Luttwak from Wiz presented it at Black Hat 2021.
