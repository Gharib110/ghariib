Policy matters. The world has never been so connected, and mighty forces contend for the right to shape our digital lives. DEF CON believes the hacker community needs a voice in that process. To help people learn, connect and get involved with the leading edge of tech policy, we offer ‘[Policy @ DEF CON](https://defcon.org/policy/)’. We’ll have presentations, panels, and off-the-record evening lounges. Get yourself up to speed on the issues, connect with some of the players and maybe even get involved. The future is what we make it!
