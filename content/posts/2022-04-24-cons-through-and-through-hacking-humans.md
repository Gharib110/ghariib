# Cons through and through Hacking Humans Goes to the Movies

<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for joining us for the latest episode of our fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Co-hosts Dave Bittner and Joe Carrigan are joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave and Joe are joined on this episode by Perry Carpenter, host of 8th Layer Insights podcast and chief evangelist at KnowBe4. Dave,Joe and Perry watch and discuss Dave's and Perry's clips on this episode. They watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then the team deconstructs what they saw. Grab your bowl of popcorn and join us for some Hollywood scams and frauds. A heads-up for our listeners: there is a bit of spicy language in today’s clips, so use your discretion if you are tuning in with your kids.  Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Dave's scene from "Focus" Perrys clip from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"
