If security needs to “Shift Left”, what can devs do to accommodate the change?

    Everyone will have to make adjustments, not just security… right?

Reverse uptime…

Forgotten data?

Test Driven Development

Why do we need security as far left?

    “We don’t patch, we just push a fix, ”

    “We’ll fix it in production…”

    Or we pump more resources to overcome perf issues

    Is there time for code reviews?

    “We don’t need change management…”

Automation: How does security that solve security issues?

    Do Microservices solve everything?

    What don’t they solve?

        What does security need to embrace to make the shift less painful?

        What does development need to embrace to make the shift less painful?

            Cause security wants to get in there…

There are already DevSecOps processes a-plenty and many . Why aren’t companies adopting them?

    Maturity?

    Lack of resources?

    Negligent devs - how can you ignore the news of breaches?

Setting Goals

    “Start Small” - what’s an example of a small goal?
