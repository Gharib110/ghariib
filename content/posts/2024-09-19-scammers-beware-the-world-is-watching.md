# Scammers beware the world is watching

<br/>

<br/>
This week, Dave and Joe share some listener follow-up from Clayton about credit card fraud and the potential issues with automatic update services that some cards provide. Dave's story is on sextortion scams targeting spouses, where scammers claim a partner is cheating and provide links to fake "proof." Joe has two stories this week, the first one is on how Police in Lebanon County arrested an alleged grandparent scammer after a sting operation. Joe's second story is on scam victims being compensated under a new Labor plan in Australia, which would fine banks, telcos, and social media platforms up to $50 million for failing to meet anti-scam obligations. Our catch of the day comes from Reddit, where someone posted a text message thread of their conversation with a scammer about a potential job. Links to the stories: Sextortion scams now use your "cheating" spouse’s name as a lure Police in Lebanon County arrest alleged grandparent scammer after sting operation Scam victims to be compensated under Labor plan to fine banks and social media platforms $50m Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
