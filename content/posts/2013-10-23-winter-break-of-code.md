# Winter Break Of Code

<br/>

<br/>
At Open Whisper Systems, we’re focused on creating easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology. Our projects are free, Open Source, and tend to be oriented around the mobile environment. We’ve been working on apps like [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) and [RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone) (which provide secure text messages and secure phone calls) for years now, because we believe that it’s possible to develop well-designed secure communication tools that are both privacy-preserving _and_ a joy to use.

This winter, we’d like to invite you to join us for “Winter Break Of Code,” a week-long free trip to Kauai for anyone who’d like to spend a week working on this type of easy-to-use privacy-enhancing technology in a collaborative environment. We’ve rented a large beachfront house on the north coast of Kauai for everyone to stay in, and we’ll pay for your airfare. While there, you can split your time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related privacy project that you propose.
