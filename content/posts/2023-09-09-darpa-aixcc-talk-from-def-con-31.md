At DEF CON 31, [DARPA announced a huge 2-year AI Cyberchallenge](https://youtu.be/DFnxrsEvs7M) with the semis and finals hosted at good old #defcon. Over 18M in total prizes, access to cutting edge tech and a chance to help secure the open infrastructure we all rely on. If that sounds like your kind of fun, details are at [http://aicyberchallenge.com](http://aicyberchallenge.com)
