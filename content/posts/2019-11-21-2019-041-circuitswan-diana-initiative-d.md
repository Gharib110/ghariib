3.  Better job descriptions

-   _Other topics of interests_

-   Career village / resume clinic work in general (spoken on this twice, volunteer at resume clinic)

-   CFP advice in general ([https://sites.google.com/site/amazonv/conference-call-for-papers-cfp-tips](https://sites.google.com/site/amazonv/conference-call-for-papers-cfp-tips) )

-   First time speaker advice in general [https://sites.google.com/site/amazonv/first-time-speaker?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/site/amazonv/first-time-speaker?authuser=0) 

-   HackerSwan ([http://hackerswan.com/](http://hackerswan.com/) )

-   HackerFoodies ([http://hackerfoodies.com/](http://hackerfoodies.com/) )

-   [http://hackersummercamp.guide/](http://hackersummercamp.guide/) aka “birds of a feather concept”

-   WAN party / Women’s meetup at Defcon with @sylv3on\_ @nemessisc and more

-   [http://hackerconticketexchange.com/](http://hackerconticketexchange.com/) 

-   GitLab security scans (that's me!) 

1.  We are responsible for baking Sec into DevOps and hence write the red team software (well integrate in most cases) for your appsec team if your devs are using GitLab. We have a security team that secures GitLab itself but that's not us. We have SAST, DAST, Dependency, Secret Detection and License Compliance baked into our paid tier, and SAST is coming down to the free tier! I’m pitching a talk about tuning to shmoocon because it seems like that's the most common question I got as a result of my devsecops talks at derbycon / shellcon / bsidesdc.
2.  1.  [N.Schwartz: Are you ready to leverage DevSecOps? BSidesDC 2019](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19OHIwK0zqzFpCEH3z7J_48cGpDSzaJbadbgPaSPbUqA/edit#slide=id.g5e25ab83a6_0_2)

-   _Also could mention getting married to RenderMan and the open wedding invite we have if you are up for party shenanigans [http://circuitswanandrenderman.com/](http://circuitswanandrenderman.com/)_

-   And i have a help guide for how to run an inclusive conference - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OCiiWRVf6r08SuI3T4Djm98GwkfzlvhjYNpS225x3M/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OCiiWRVf6r08SuI3T4Djm98GwkfzlvhjYNpS225x3M/edit)

Layer8conf - [https://www.workshopcon.com/events](https://www.workshopcon.com/events)

Regarding diversity scholarships, it's being worked on and the number of available spots will highly depend on the number of Sponsorships the conference secures.

As a side note WorkshopCon will sponsor a number of Layer8 conference tickets if people follow @WorkshopCon on Twitter and tweet to us why they are interested in Social Engineering and OSINT topics with hashtag #sendMeToLayer8. We will select folks from those tweets with the emphasis being on folks coming from underrepresented or minority groups.

In terms of sponsorship information for Layer8, Patrick wants people to send an email to sponsors@layer8conference.com

Please let us know if you have any other questions, and thank you so much for giving us a hand spreading the word!!!
