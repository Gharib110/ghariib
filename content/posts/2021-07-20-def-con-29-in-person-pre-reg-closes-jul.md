Notice for #defcon29 in-person attendees: Online registration closes July 29. That's your last chance to buy a guaranteed badge. After that it's cash at the door, but please know that we’ve only got about 1,000 spaces for cash customers.  
  
To be certain you get in, registering online by the 29th is your best bet. We don’t want to turn anyone away but we will once we reach capacity. Please consider pre-reg at [http://shop.defcon.org](https://shop.defcon.org) if you don't want to YOLO it at the door.  
  
Masks and proof of vaccination remain 100% required.
