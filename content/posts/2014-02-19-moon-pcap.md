# Moon Pcap

<br/>

<br/>
I thought I'd try something a little different. I usually use the blogger.com to talk, but I didn't see a reason to waste all this excellent space, so I'll put my post here.

Last night on Twitter, someone had posted a pcap file of the MOON self-replicating malware running through many newer brands of Linksys router.Â  So I thought I would post the pcap file here for all you packet weasels to enjoy.

Also, we will be posting our Part 2 of Michael Gough, an Austin-based Malware researcher, who enjoys getting an infection for a living.
