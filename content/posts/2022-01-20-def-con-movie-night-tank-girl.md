This week’s DEF CON movie night will feature the very weird ‘Tank Girl’ from 1995. Join us Saturday, 8pm PST in the movie-night-text channel of the [DEF CON discord](https://discord.gg/defcon) for a glimpse at what the apocalypse looked like from the more innocent viewpoint of the mid 90s. Bring your own water.
