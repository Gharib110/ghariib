# How We Measure ISP User Counts

<br/>

<br/>
At APNIC Labs we generate, on a daily ongoing basis, our estimate of the number of users per ISP for every ISP that we see on the Internet through the ad-based measurement platform. This report is published at the URL: https://stats.labs.apnic.net/aspop. As far as we are aware this is the only such public data set that encompasses the entirety of the public Internet. Here I would like to explain how we calculate this data, and provide some responses to a recent presentation at the RIPE 89 meeting on this data set.
