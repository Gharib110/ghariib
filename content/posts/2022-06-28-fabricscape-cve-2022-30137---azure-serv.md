# FabricScape CVE-2022-30137 - Azure Service Fabric privilege escalation

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability in Service Fabric allows Linux containers to escalate their privileges in order to gain root privileges on the node, and then compromise all of the nodes in the cluster. An attacker would need to have read/write access to the cluster, and the vulnerability could be exploited on containers that are configured to have runtime access, but this is granted by default to every container. Though the bug exists in both the Windows and Linux versions, it is only exploitable on Linux.
