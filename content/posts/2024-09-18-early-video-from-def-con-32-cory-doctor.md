Please enjoy [Cory Doctorow's fantastic presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EmstuO0Em8) on taking back the internet from last month at DEF CON 32. Cory's takes are always thoughtful, provocative and it was his deshittification concept that helped inspire the DC32 theme. More videos from DEF CON coming soon.
