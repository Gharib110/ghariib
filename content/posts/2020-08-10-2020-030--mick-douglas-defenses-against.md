Hey... I wanna talk about @hrbrmstr's tweet on the show tonight as well...

My thinking is if Cisco and others didn't try to intentionally downplay vulnerabilities by announcing them on a Friday, would we be more likely to patch sooner? Also, greater need for testing of patches to ensure that 80% of your workforce rely on that technology now. What's worse? Patching on a Friday evening (after several hours explaining the vuln to a manager), and then having it fuck something up so you're up at crack of dawn Monday troubleshooting something missed Friday night because testing was rushed/not conducted because the CEO can't access email?

I have thoughts, I've added this to the show note google doc.

Embargoed vulns…
