# 2016-050 Holiday Spectacular with a little help from our friends

<br/>

<br/>
Brakesec Podcast joined:

Edgar #Rojas (@silverFox) and Tracy #Maleef (@infosecSherpa) from the #PVC #Security #podcast (@pvcsec)

Joe Gray (@C\_3PJoe) from the Advanced Persistent Security Podcast

Jerry #Bell (@maliciousLink) and Andrew #Kalat (@lerg) from the #Defensive Security podcast (@defensiveSec)

And Amanda #Berlin (@infosystir) for a light-hearted holiday party. We discuss things we learned this year, and most of us refrained from making the famous "#prediction" lists. You also get to hear my lovely wife come in and bring me #holiday #sweeties and even dinner, as she had no idea we were recording at the time (she later told me "You sounded like you were having too much fun, so I assumed you weren't recording")

\*\*there might be some explicit language\*\*

Join us won't you, and listen to 3 fantastic podcasts mix it up for the holidays.
