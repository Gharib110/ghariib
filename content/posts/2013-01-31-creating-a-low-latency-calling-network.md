When we were developing RedPhone, we discovered that the cryptographic aspects of it were relatively straightforward. What we didn’t anticipate was how difficult the mechanics of delivering high-quality, low-latency, and highly available voice communication would be.

This describes the basic strategy we developed for the network side of low-latency and highly available calls.
