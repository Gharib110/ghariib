# Thank you from Brakeing Down Security

<br/>

<br/>
When Mr. Boettcher and I started the Brakeing Down Security Podcast, we really did it for 2 reasons:

1\. We wanted to educate people and ourselves about information security topics, and do it in a way that was fun

2\. Educate ourselves about some topics that we were not familar with, because infosec and compliance is such a vast range of topics and skills

Mr. Boettcher and I want to extend a warm and hearty THANK YOU SO MUCH for inviting us into your podcasting listening device. We realize there are a ton of infosec podcasts out there, and you allowing us to share space with them makes us so happy.

Look for more podcasts in December, and in the new year, look for more videos and excellent interviews.

As we've always said, we do this podcast for you, and we want to know what you want to hear or see.  If you have a topic you'd love to have us talk about, or you'd like to come on our podcast and talk about something you're working on, please let us know.  We want input, so please leave us some feedback on iTunes, or tweet our podcast to your friends

Happy Thanksgiving to our US fans, Happy Thursday for the rest of the world...
