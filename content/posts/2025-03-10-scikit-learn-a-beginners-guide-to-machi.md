# Scikit-learn A Beginners Guide to Machine Learning in Python

<br/>

<br/>
### [Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)

![python scikit learn tutorial](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/01/python-scikit-learn.png).

Scikit-learn is one of the most widely used Python libraries for machine learning. Whether you’re working on classification, regression, or clustering tasks, Scikit-learn provides simple and efficient tools to build and evaluate models.

It features several regression, classification, and clustering algorithms, including SVMs, gradient boosting, k-means, random forests, and DBSCAN. It is designed to work with Python [Numpy](/community/tutorials/python-numpy-tutorial) and [SciPy](/community/tutorials/python-tutorial-beginners).

[What is Scikit-learn in Python?](#what-is-scikit-learn-in-python)[](#what-is-scikit-learn-in-python)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is written in Python (most of it), and some of its core algorithms are written in [Cython](https://cython.org/) for even better performance. Scikit-learn is used to build models and it is not recommended to use it for reading, manipulating and summarizing data as there are better frameworks available for the purpose. It is open source and released under BSD license.

It provides various tools for:

-   **Classification (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests)**.
    
-   **Regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression)**.
    
-   **Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)**.
    
-   **Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, LDA)**.
    
-   **Feature Selection**.
    

[Using Scikit Learn](#using-scikit-learn)[](#using-scikit-learn)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### [Install Scikit Learn](#install-scikit-learn)[](#install-scikit-learn)

Scikit assumes you have a running Python 2.7 or above platform with NumPY (1.8.2 and above) and SciPY (0.13.3 and above) packages on your device. Once we have these packages installed we can proceed with the installation. For [pip](/community/tutorials/python-pip) installation, run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install scikit-learn
```

If you like `conda`, you can also use the conda for package installation, run the following command:

```
conda install scikit-learn
```

[Using Scikit-Learn](#using-scikit-learn)[](#using-scikit-learn)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Once you are done with the installation, you can use scikit-learn easily in your Python code by importing it as:

```
import sklearn
```

### [Scikit Learn Loading Dataset](#scikit-learn-loading-dataset)[](#scikit-learn-loading-dataset)

Let’s start with loading a dataset to play with. Let’s load a simple dataset named Iris. It is a dataset of a flower, it contains 150 observations about different measurements of the flower. Let’s see how to load the dataset using scikit-learn.

```
# Import scikit learn
from sklearn import datasets
# Load data
iris= datasets.load_iris()
# Print shape of data to confirm data is loaded
print(iris.data.shape)
```

We are printing shape of data for ease, you can also print whole data if you wish so, running the codes gives an output like this: ![python scikit dataset load](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/01/python-scikit-load-dataset-1.png)

### [Scikit Learn SVM - Learning and Predicting](#scikit-learn-svm-learning-and-predicting)[](#scikit-learn-svm-learning-and-predicting)

Now we have loaded data, let’s try learning from it and predict on new data. For this purpose we have to create an estimator and then call its fit method.

```
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn import datasets
# Load dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
clf = svm.LinearSVC()
# learn from the data
clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
# predict for unseen data
clf.predict([[ 5.0,  3.6,  1.3,  0.25]])
# Parameters of model can be changed by using the attributes ending with an underscore
print(clf.coef_ )
```

Here is what we get when we run this script: ![Scikit Learn SVM](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/01/python-scikit-predicting.png)

### [Scikit Learn Linear Regression](#scikit-learn-linear-regression)[](#scikit-learn-linear-regression)

Creating various models is rather simple using scikit-learn. Let’s start with a simple example of regression.

```
#import the model
from sklearn import linear_model
reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()
# use it to fit a data
reg.fit ([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]], [0, 1, 2])
# Let's look into the fitted data
print(reg.coef_)
```

Running the model should return a point that can be plotted on the same line: ![python scikit learn linear regression](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/01/python-scikit-linear-regression.png)

### [k-Nearest neighbour classifier](#k-nearest-neighbour-classifier)[](#k-nearest-neighbour-classifier)

Let’s try a simple classification algorithm. This classifier uses an algorithm based on ball trees to represent the training samples.

```
from sklearn import datasets
# Load dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
# Create and fit a nearest-neighbor classifier
from sklearn import neighbors
knn = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
# Predict and print the result
result=knn.predict([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]])
print(result)
```

Let’s run the classifier and check results, the classifier should return 0. Let’s try the example: ![python scikit learn classification](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/01/python-scikit-k-Nearest-neighbour.png)

### [K-means clustering](#k-means-clustering)[](#k-means-clustering)

This is the simplest clustering algorithm. The set is divided into ‘k’ clusters and each observation is assigned to a cluster. This is done iteratively until the clusters converge. We will create one such clustering model in the following program:

```
from sklearn import cluster, datasets
# load data
iris = datasets.load_iris()
# create clusters for k=3
k=3
k_means = cluster.KMeans(k)
# fit data
k_means.fit(iris.data)
# print results
print( k_means.labels_[::10])
print( iris.target[::10])
```

On running the program we’ll see separate clusters in the list. Here is the output for above code snippet: ![python scikit learn clustering](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/01/python-scikit-Clustering.png).

[Handling Large Datasets in Scikit-learn](#handling-large-datasets-in-scikit-learn)[](#handling-large-datasets-in-scikit-learn)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scikit-learn is a powerful library for machine learning, but it’s optimized for small to medium-sized datasets. When working with large datasets, you need to handle them efficiently. Here are some strategies:

-   **Use `partial_fit()`:** This method supports incremental learning for large datasets. It’s particularly useful when you can’t fit the entire dataset into memory at once.
    
-   **Apply Feature Selection**: Reducing the number of features in your dataset can significantly reduce memory usage and computation time.
    
-   **Leverage `joblib` for Parallel Processing:** This library can be used to distribute tasks across multiple cores, which can greatly speed up your computations.
    

Here’s an example of using `partial_fit()`:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
import numpy as np

# Initialize a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier model
model = SGDClassifier()

# Loop through 10 batches of data
for batch in range(10):
    # Generate a batch of random features (X_batch) with shape (1000, 20)
    X_batch = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
    # Generate a batch of random target values (y_batch) with shape (1000,) containing either 0 or 1
    y_batch = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
    # Use the partial_fit method to train the model on the current batch of data
    # This method is particularly useful for large datasets that cannot fit into memory at once
    # The 'classes' parameter is specified to ensure the model is aware of the classes it's training on
    model.partial_fit(X_batch, y_batch, classes=[0, 1])
```
