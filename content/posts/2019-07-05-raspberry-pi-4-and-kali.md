We love the Raspberry Pi, and judging by the response we got to a [late night tweet](https://twitter.com/kalilinux/status/1144895236025585665) we sent out last weekend a lot of you love the Pi too!

Because of that, when the [Pi 4 dropped](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/) we wanted to get Kali supported on it right away.

What’s new on the Raspberry Pi 4?
---------------------------------

The Raspberry Pi 4 is actually a pretty amazing little machine. The Pi has always been known for its low cost and easy accessibility, but with the 4 we can actually throw real performance onto that list as well.

With the Raspberry Pi 4 we have a completely upgraded, re-engineered device that includes:

-   A more powerful CPU
-   Options for 1, 2, or 4 GB of RAM
-   USB-C power supply
-   USB 2 & USB 3
-   Gigabit ethernet
-   2 micro HDMI ports

And now you can add to that list full Kali Linux support complete with on-board wifi monitor mode & frame injection support!

To say we are excited about this is an understatement, and we hope many of you are just as excited!

Try it out!
-----------

You can download Kali Linux for the Raspberry Pi 4 on the [Kali ARM download page](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm). Currently we only have 32Bit support for it, but expect 64Bit in the near future. The installation instructions are not any different than the Pi2, so feel free to [follow our docs](https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-2/) on getting it setup if you don’t know how.

Once you have it running feel free to let us know how its working for you [on our forums](https://forums.kali.org/forumdisplay.php?7-Kali-Linux-ARM-Architecture). Stay tuned for more Pi updates as we work with the 4 and find new and interesting things to do with it!
