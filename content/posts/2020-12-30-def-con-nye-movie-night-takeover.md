This week’s [NYE edition of DEF CON’s Movie Night](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-nye-2021/dc-nye-2021-index.html#movienight) is being hosted by the Cult of the Dead Cow! The OG hacker supergroup will be in the movie night channel sharing a curated list of videos, telling tales and answering your questions.  
  
If you know the Cult of the Dead Cow, you don’t need us to tell you how cool this is. If you don’t, just know they’ve been holding down the elite hacker strike force space since before you hacked your Teddy Ruxpin, and this is the perfect time to fill in that crucial gap in your grasp of hacker lore.  
  
Follow us on defcon.org and [@defcon](https://twitter.com/defcon) for times and video listings, and visit [cultdeadcow.com](https://cultdeadcow.com) to see what the cult is up to now.
