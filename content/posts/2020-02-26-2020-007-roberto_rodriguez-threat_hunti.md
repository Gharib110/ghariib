Threat Intel vs. Threat Hunting = what’s the difference?

What datasets are you using? 

Did you start with any particular dataset, or created your own?

Technique development - what skills are needed?

    C2 setup

    Detection mechanisms

    Honeypots

How can people get involved?

Blacksmith - create ‘mordor’ environment to push scripts to setup honeypot/nets

SIGMA?

**What is a Notebook?**
-----------------------

Think of a notebook as a document that you can access via a web interface that allows you to save input (i.e live code) and output (i.e code execution results / evaluated code output) of interactive sessions as well as important notes needed to explain the methodology and steps taken to perform specific tasks (i.e data analysis).

Have a goal for expanding to other parts of ATT&CK?

**Threat Hunter Playbook - Goals**
==================================

-   Expedite the development of techniques an hypothesis for hunting campaigns.
-   Help Threat Hunters understand patterns of behavior observed during post-exploitation.
-   Reduce the number of false positives while hunting by providing more context around suspicious events.
-   Share real-time analytics validation examples through cloud computing environments for free.
-   Distribute Threat Hunting concepts and processes around the world for free.
-   Map pre-recorded datasets to adversarial techniques.
-   Accelerate infosec learning through open source resources.

“GreyMatter integrates security data from security incident and event manager (SIEM), endpoint detection and response (EDR), firewalls, threat intelligence feeds, and other security tools, and includes analysis functions and automation. Threatcare's technology — which will become a new feature on the platform — simulates how a specific threat or attack could target an organization's network in order to determine whether its security tools and settings are or are not actually working to thwart the threats.”

Security model - everyone’s is diff

    How do you work with your threat model?

    A proper threat model

**Attack Simulation -** 

    How is this different from doing a typical Incident Response tabletop? Threat modeling systems?

    How is this different than a pentest?

    Is this automated red teaming? How effective can automated testing be?

    Is this like some kind of constant scanning system?

    How does this work with threat intel feeds? 

    Can it simulate ransomware, or any attacks?

Hedgehog principles

    A lot of things crappily, and nothing good
