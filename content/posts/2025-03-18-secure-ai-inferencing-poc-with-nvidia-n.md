# Secure AI inferencing POC with NVIDIA NIM on CoCo with OpenShift AI





Confidential computing strengthens application security by providing isolation, encryption and attestation so data remains protected while in use. By integrating these security features with a scalable, high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, organizations can adopt a defense-in-depth approach.

Confidential computing strengthens application security by providing isolation, encryption and attestation so data remains protected while in use. By integrating these security features with a scalable, high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) ecosystem, organizations can adopt a defense-in-depth approach. This is especially critical for regulated industries handling sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and financial information, enabling them to leverage AI with confidence.In this article, we expl
