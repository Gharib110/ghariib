# AWS AI services ToS allow sharing of customer data

<br/>

<br/>
Use of the AI services on AWS allows customer data to be moved outside of the regions it is used in and potentially shared with third-parties. Note: This issue is outside the scope of this database's usual criteria for inclusion, but has been kept for historic reasons, as it was included in the original CSP Security Mistakes dataset.
