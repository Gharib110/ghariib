# the last Derbycon Brakesec podcast

<br/>

<br/>
This evening, we all came together to spend a bit of time talking about the final Derbycon. We talk to Mic Douglas about his 9 Derbycon appearances, Gary Rimar (piano player Extraordinare) talks about @litmoose's talk on how to tell C-Levels that their applications aren't good.

We also got asked about how the show came about, and how we found each other.

\*\*Apologies for the echo in some parts... I did what I could to clean it up, but we were too close and the mics got a bit overzealous...\*\*
