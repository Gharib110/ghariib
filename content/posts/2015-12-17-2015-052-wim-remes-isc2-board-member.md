# 2015-052 Wim Remes-ISC2 board member

<br/>

<br/>
I got a hold of Mr. Wim Remes, because he was elected to the ISC board in November 2015.  Recent changes to the CISSP included changing the long-standing 10 domains down to 8 domains, plus a major revamp to all of them.

I wanted to know what Mr. Remes' plans were for the coming term, how the board works, and how organizations like ISC2 drive change in the industry. I also asked Wim how he is trying to ensure that CISSP and the other certs are going to remain current and competitive.

This is a great interview if you're looking to get your #CISSP or any other ISC2 cert, or you currently have an #ISC2 #certification and want to get knowledge of the workings of ISC2 and the board.
