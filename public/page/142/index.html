Big Tech has monopolized its infrastructure, and governments all over the world are too eager to capitalize.</p>

Depending on the privileges associated with the service account an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Service accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
