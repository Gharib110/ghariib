DEF CON 30 is going to be a big deal, and we’re full speed ahead on planning. If you’ve got a stellar idea for a contest, this is your moment. Take advantage of the early opening to turn your idea into a real DEF CON Experience. The extra lead time helps us work with you to get the best ideas across the finish line, but only if you take advantage and get your submissions in.  
  
You can read the rules and requirements on the [Call for Contests Page](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-30/dc-30-cfce.html). You can check the [DC29 Contest forum](https://forum.defcon.org/node/236370) for an idea of what we’ve accepted in the past.  
  
Let’s see what you’ve got percolating out there, DEF CON fam. Let’s take DC30 up a notch.
