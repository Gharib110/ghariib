# Privacy and DNS Client Subnet

<br/>

<br/>
To ensure service consistency in a Content Distribution Network (CDN) replicated instances of the content are named with the same DNS name, and the DNS conventionally offers the same resolution outcome to each user when they query for the IP address of the content server. How can the CDN "steer" each user to the closest instance of the desired content to optimise the subsequent content transaction? At the same time the user is revealing their location within the network to inform this steering decision. To what extent is such a steering function compromising the privacy expectations of users with respect to the location and their online actions?
