# The UK Adopts an Online Safety Bill That Allows Regulation of Encrypted Messaging

<br/>

<br/>
Our headline story for this episode of the Cyberlaw Podcast is the U.K.’s [sweeping new Online Safety Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/technology/britain-online-safety-law.html?utm_source=pocket_saves), which regulates social media in a host of ways. [Mark MacCarthy](https://cbpp.georgetown.edu/people/mark-maccarthy/) spells some of them out, but the big surprise is encryption. U.S. encrypted messaging companies used up all the oxygen in the room hyperventilating about the risk that end-to-end encryption would be regulated. Journalists paid little attention in the past year or two to all the other regulatory provisions. And even then, they got it wrong, [gleefully claiming](https://therecord.media/online-safety-bill-uk-end-to-end-encryption?utm_source=pocket_saves) that the U.K. backed down and took the authority to regulate encrypted apps out of [the bill.](https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/52368/documents/3841?utm_source=pocket_saves) Mark and I explain just how wrong they are. It was the messaging companies who blinked and are [now pretending they won](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/meredith-whittaker-reaffirms-that-signal-would-leave-u-k-if-forced-by-privacy-bill/?utm_source=pocket_saves). 

In cybersecurity news, [David Kris](https://culperpartners.com/) and I have kind words for the Department of Homeland Security’s report on how to coordinate [cyber incident reporting](https://therecord.media/dhs-floats-single-cyber-incident-reporting-portal?utm_source=pocket_saves). Unfortunately, there is a vast gulf between writing a report on coordinating incident reporting and actually coordinating incident reporting. David also offers a generous view of the conservative catfight between former Congressman Bob Goodlatte on one side and [Michael Ellis](https://www.heritage.org/staff/michael-j-ellis) and me on the other. The latest installment in that conflict is [here](https://therecord.media/dhs-floats-single-cyber-incident-reporting-portal?utm_source=pocket_saves).

If you need to catch up on the raft of antitrust litigation launched by the Biden administration, [Gus Hurwitz](https://www.law.upenn.edu/faculty/ghurwitz) has you covered. First, he explains what’s at stake [in the Justice Department’s case](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/21/technology/google-antitrust-duckduckgo.html) against Google – and [why we don’t know more about](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-emails-memos-hidden-doj-135549032.html?utm_source=pocket_saves) it. Then he previews the imminent [Federal Trade Commission (FTC) case against Amazon](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ftc-nears-antitrust-showdown-with-amazon-this-month-6dc34157?utm_source=pocket_saves). Followed by his criticism of Lina Khan’s decision to [name three Amazon execs](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ftc-updates-amazon-suit-over-prime-enrollment-naming-executives-88eb08d?mod=followamazon&utm_source=pocket_saves) as targets in the FTC’s other big Amazon case – over Prime membership. Amazon is clearly Lina Khan’s White Whale, but that doesn’t mean that everyone who works there is sushi.

Mark picks up the competition law theme, explaining the [U.K. competition watchdog’s principles for AI regulation](https://telecoms.com/523787/uk-competition-watchdog-fleshes-out-approach-to-ai-regulation/?utm_source=pocket_saves). Along the way, he shows that whether AI is regulated by one entity or several could have a profound impact on what kind of regulation AI gets.

I update listeners on [the litigation](https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/appeals-judges-compare-biden-social-media-pressure-mafia-supervisor?utm_source=pocket_saves) over the Biden administration’s pressure on social media companies to ban misinformation and use it to plug the [latest Cybertoonz commentary](https://reason.com/volokh/2023/09/25/cybertoonz-explains-the-governments-right-to-speak/) on the case. I also note the Commerce Department claim that its controls on chip technology have not failed, arguing that there’s [no evidence that China can make advanced chips “at scale.”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-19/no-evidence-that-china-can-make-advanced-chips-at-scale-us-says?embedded-checkout=true&utm_source=pocket_saves)  But the Commerce Department would say that, wouldn’t they? Finally, for This Week in Anticlimactic Privacy News, I note that the U.K. has decided, following the EU ruling, that U.S. law is “adequate” for transatlantic data transfers.
