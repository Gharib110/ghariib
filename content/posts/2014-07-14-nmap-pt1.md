# Nmap pt1

<br/>

<br/>
So, I uploaded this little tutorial of nmap, a very nice tool I use on a regular basis, both at home and at work.

I did some basic scans, showed off the command line and the Windows 'Zenmap' version, as well as discussed some regularly used switches.

The next video I do about nmap will discuss more switches, the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), and how to format reports and the output nmap provides.
