# CVE-2024-8769 - Aimhubio Aim File Deletion Vulnerability Arbitrary File Deletion

<br/>

<br/>
**CVE ID :** CVE-2024-8769  
**Published :** March 20, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 12 minutes ago  
**Description :** A vulnerability in the \`LockManager.release\_locks\` function in aimhubio/aim (commit bb76afe) allows for arbitrary file deletion through relative path traversal. The \`run\_hash\` parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization as part of a path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through the \`Repo.\_close\_run()\` method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction API. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the machine running the tracking server.  
**Severity:** 9.1 | CRITICAL
