# Hustling the hustler and three-card Monte Hacking Humans Goes to the Movies

<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for joining us for Episode 4 of our fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Co-hosts Dave Bittner and Joe Carrigan are joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave, Joe and Rick are watching Joe's and Rick's scene picks. They watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then the team deconstructs what they saw. Grab your popcorn and join us for a trip to the movies. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: Joe's clip from "The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air: Pool Hall Hustle" scene Rick's pick from "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"
