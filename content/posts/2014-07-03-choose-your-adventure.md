# Choose your adventure

<br/>

<br/>
Hello valued Listener! I want to do another video, and I thought that you might want to decide which one piece of software I highlight. So here are three options:  
  
1\. Nikto  
2\. Nmap  
3\. OpenVAS  
  
You can send me your choice to my twitter (@bryanbrake) or to my gmail account (bds.podcast@gmail.com).  
  
I will be taking input until 0000 UTC on Sunday July 6th (1800 Saturday 5 July US/Eastern). You can only vote once.
