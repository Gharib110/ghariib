# Another new room block - The RIO

We’ve secured a [block of deeply discounted rooms at the fabulous Rio](https://book.passkey.com/gt/219994873?gtid=61fe6fbb382f8c0f53f21fea47821433), with FREE shuttle service to and from the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center! In addition to the door-to-door shuttle service, they’re giving us a big break on the room rate AND the Resort Fee. Rio also offers [additional discounts for government employees](https://book.passkey.com/gt/219994888?gtid=8024fa5af2024b9e294865eb034b9017)

We love the Rio - it was home base for DEF CONs 19-22 - and you should see it now. It’s had a massive multi-year renovation and it’s new all over. New all-suites accomodations, new restaurants, new food hall, even a redesigned 5-acre pool complex. It’s a whole new experience at a steal of a price.

We expect these to fill quickly, so you should act accordingly and book now!
