# A Vulnerability in Apache Struts2 Could Allow for Remote Code Execution

<br/>

<br/>
A vulnerability has been discovered in Apache Struts2, which could allow for remote code execution. Apache Struts2 is an open-source web application framework used for developing Java web applications. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the affected service account. Depending on the privileges associated with the service account, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Services whose accounts are configured to have less rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
