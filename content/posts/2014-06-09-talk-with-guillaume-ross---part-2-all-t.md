# Talk with Guillaume Ross - Part 2 all things cloud

<br/>

<br/>
This is part 2 of our podcast interview with Guillaume Ross, Infosec professional who is well versed with the intricacies of various cloud architectures, whether they are IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.  This part of the podcast discussed how contracts are established, and we ask if smaller cloud providers have a chance against behemoths like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
