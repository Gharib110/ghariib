Governance as Code - [https://www.cio.com/article/3277611/governance-as-code-keeping-pace-with-the-rate-of-change-in-the-cloud.html](https://www.cio.com/article/3277611/governance-as-code-keeping-pace-with-the-rate-of-change-in-the-cloud.html) 

“In the future, governance as code will be the backbone driving our IT systems and services. It will enable us to deliver consistent, efficient and highly repeating business outcomes at the lowest possible cost, with the maximum availability and security, while also allowing our people to expand into new and higher value-add roles across business.”

“Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file.”

“Shield is an active defense knowledge base MITRE is developing to capture and organize what we are learning about active defense and adversary engagement. Derived from over 10 years of adversary engagement experience, it spans the range from high level, CISO ready considerations of opportunities and objectives, to practitioner friendly discussions of the TTPs available to defenders.”

IR Playbooks -  

process of creating them (probably the hardest)

Implementation

Tabletop exercise (length, stakeholders, crafting a scenario to compare against)

What if an org has nothing? “We just blow up the environment and start over."

RTO/RPO metrics: How long can you survive as a company with an outage? How long does it take to get back online and operational? What’s your appetite for the risk of that?

Lots of dependencies to creating

**Tabletop discussion -**

**sponsors involved**

**Initiating condition**

**Threat modeling**

**Process steps**

**Best practices and local policies**

**End state - what is the goal? (eradicate infection, back to operating status)**

**Relation to governance/regulatory reqs. (do we have to report? What do we report? Fallout from incident, etc)**

**Lessons Learned**

[https://sbscyber.com/resources/7-steps-to-building-an-incident-response-playbook](https://sbscyber.com/resources/7-steps-to-building-an-incident-response-playbook) (seems like there are different methodologies)
