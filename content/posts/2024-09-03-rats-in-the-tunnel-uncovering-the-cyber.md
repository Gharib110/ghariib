# RATs in the tunnel Uncovering the cyber underworld OMITB

<br/>

<br/>
Welcome in! You’ve entered, Only Malware in the Building. Join us each month to sip tea and solve mysteries about today’s most interesting threats. Your host is Selena Larson, Proofpoint intelligence analyst and host of their podcast DISCARDED. Inspired by the residents of a building in New York’s exclusive upper west side, Selena is joined by N2K Networks Dave Bittner and Rick Howard to uncover the stories behind notable cyberattacks.  Being a security researcher is a bit like being a detective: you gather clues, analyze the evidence, and consult the experts to solve the cyber puzzle. On this episode, we talk about the abuse of legitimate services for malware delivery. Proofpoint has seen an increase in the abuse of tools like ScreenConnect and NetSupport, as well as Cloudflare Tunnel abuse and the use of IP filtering. They have also observed a rise in financially motivated malware delivery using TryCloudflare Tunnel abuse, focusing on remote access trojans (RATs) like Xworm and AsyncRAT. Today we look at how Cloudflare tunnels are used to evade detection and how they have evolved their tactics by incorporating obfuscation techniques, with ongoing research to identify the threat actors involved.
