**Reparations.tech****\*Public Safety Coordinators****\-Field Operations (Road Incidents)****\-Specialized Buildings (The Library, Medical Facilities, CCR)****\*Public Safety Officers****A. Discuss Training****\-**SOP Creation  
\*SOPs are very custom and dependent on the organization. There are no “NIST” standards.  
\[IN CYBER: Frameworks for Physical Security --->     \] 

\*Think on your feet, many plans often get thrown out the window.  
\*Creating policies due to unforeseen incidents  
  
\-Physical Security Assessments: Fire Panels, AED, Roof Accesses 

\*The Checklist: Baseline configuration of the operations for a building  
\*Locksmith Troubleshooting  
\*Lack of Funding (Historically) + Ways to Address this In-House

1.  **Situational Awareness****(?)** “What is Situational Awareness?” 

\-There’s a lack of good training to discuss their own physical security

\*Ph.Ds leaving car doors wide open, blaming safety officers when they mess up  
\*Common sense is not so common  
\*Scenarios don’t always cover every event

\*Dead bodies, car accidents, people streaking (lol), medical issues  
\-Policies can be simple, like opening a car door

\*Need to vet whether the person is actually their car

Have you seen both good and bad training on situational awareness? Does it seem to differ between physical and cyber security?

1.  companies heading back to work

1.  What should IT or Security think about for your businesses that may not have had people in for 6-9 months?
2.  If companies don’t have cameras or physical controls, should they think about looking at improving?
