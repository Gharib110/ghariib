# DEF CON 29 Registration Pricing Chart

DEF CON 29 is our first hybrid con, and the first time we’ve had more than one price for badges. It’s caused a few questions. To answer them, we’ve created this [handy price comparison chart](https://defcon.org/images/defcon-29/pricechartupdate.png).  
  
If you bought your badge through Black Hat, you’ve purchased the $300 onsite option. If you haven’t signed up yet, badges are available at [shop.defcon.org](https://shop.defcon.org). To upgrade to Human+ status on the Discord, visit [plus.defcon.org](https://plus.defcon.org).  
  
Thank you so much for supporting DEF CON in this crazy time – we can’t wait to be together again in August.
