The latest Signal betas are rolling out today. Inside, you’ll find performance enhancements, a slew of bug fixes, improvements to the mute settings, and if you’re in the United Kingdom, you’ll see support for Signal Payments – a new feature that enables you to send and receive privacy focused payments as easily as sending or receiving a message. This is a beta feature in a [beta build](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-), but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback.
