**Update:** This feature is now available in production.

The latest beta release of Signal Desktop includes preliminary support for one-to-one voice and video calls. Call your friends and family on macOS, Windows, and Linux; see their smiles on a larger screen; hear their laughter through the big speakers on your desk; and help us test the next generation of calling on Signal.

Beta users get an early chance to evaluate call quality and performance while we continue to improve the interface and work on upcoming features.
