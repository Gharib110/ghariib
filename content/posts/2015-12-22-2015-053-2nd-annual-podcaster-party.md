# 2015-053 2nd annual podcaster party

<br/>

<br/>
This week, we went off the tracks a bit with our friends at Defensive Security Podcast, and PVC Security Podcast. We discussed a bit of news, talked about how our podcasts differ from one another, the 'lack of infosec talent', and sat around talking about anything we wanted to.

Sit back with some eggnog, and let your ears savor the sounds of the season. Â Many thanks to Andrew Kalat, Jerry Bell, Edgar Rojas, Paul Jorgensen, and co-host Brian Boettcher for getting together for some good natured fun.

WARNING: There is adult language, and themes, so if you have little ones around, you might want to skip this one until after bedtime.

Happy Holidays from Brakeing Down Security Podcast.
