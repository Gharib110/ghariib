# VulnCheck Named CVE Numbering Authority for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

<br/>

<br/>
On the Heels of Accreditation, Company Launches Advisories Program to Simplify How Researchers Share Vulnerabilities with Vendors \\n\\n\*\*LEXINGTON, Mass\*\*. - April 12, 2023 - VulnCheck, the vulnerability intelligence company, today \[announced\](https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2023/04/11/VulnCheck-Added-as-CNA) it has been authorized by the \[CVE Program\](https://www.cve.org/) as a \[CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)\](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/CNAs). The company also announced the launch of VulnCheck Advisories, a program designed to simplify how security researchers share vulnerabilities with vendors.\\n \\nThe CVE Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, with a mission to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. As a CNA, VulnCheck joins an elite group of over 280 partners in 36 countries authorized to assign CVE identification numbers to vulnerabilities and publish additional details in the associated CVE record.\\n\\n::author-quote\\n---\\nauthor: Anthony Bettini \\nposition: Founder at VulnCheck\\n---\\nOur company offers the most comprehensive, real-time vulnerability, threat and exploit intelligence available on the market today, partnering with the CVE Program to put that data to use is the latest step weâ€™re taking to help security teams fight back against the growing tide of vulnerabilities they face each day.\\n::\\n\\nIn conjunction with the accreditation, the company also launched \[VulnCheck Advisories\](https://vulncheck.com/advisories), a program designed to remove friction between researchers who identify and report vulnerabilities and the organizations that acknowledge and fix the flaws. The program enables researchers to share newly discovered vulnerabilities directly with VulnCheck. The intelligence company then takes over the submission process to the vendor and guarantees the vulnerability is published within 120 days, whether fixed or not. \\n\\n::author-quote\\n---\\nauthor: Anthony Bettini \\nposition: Founder at VulnCheck\\n---\\nA lot of the time, researchers are at a disadvantage, programs that buy vulnerabilities can be cumbersome and rife with restrictions. In addition, if researchers choose to work directly with a vendor, they can often spend months just trying to get the company to acknowledge their report. With our program, researchers can submit their findings to VulnCheck and let the process run its course without all the hassle.\\n::\\n\\nThe news comes just months after the company raised a $3.2 million seed round to increase hiring, bolster product development and help large enterprises, government agencies and cybersecurity solutions providers outpace adversaries by solving the vulnerability prioritization challenge. \\n\\n\\nTo learn more about VulnCheck and the Advisories program, visit https://vulncheck.com/advisories. \\n\\n### About VulnCheck\\nVulnCheck is the vulnerability intelligence company helping enterprises, government organizations, and cybersecurity vendors solve the vulnerability prioritization challenge.
