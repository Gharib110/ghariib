# Interview with creator of Simple Risk Josh Sokol Part 1

<br/>

<br/>
Josh Sokol is on the International OWASP board of directors in addition to being the Information Security Program Owner at National Instruments in Austin, Texas. This week, he sat down with Brakeing Down Security to talk about Simple Risk, his homebrew application that assists people and organizations in managing their business risk, and at a much nicer cost that other GRC applications (it's free!) Check out Part 1 below. If you're at BlackHat 2014 this year, he will be showcasing it at Arsenal!
