Proposal:  Anonymous Hacker segment

    Similar to “The Stig” on Top Gear. If you would like to come on and discuss any topic you would like. You’ll have anonymity, we won’t share your contact info

1.  Will allow people worried that they’ll be ridiculed to share their knowledge
2.  We can record your 20-30 segment whenever (will need audio/video for it)
3.  You can take a tutorial from another site (or your own) and review it for us
4.  1-2 segments per month 
5.  We can discuss content prior to (we won’t put you on the spot)

**Google removed 1.7K+ Joker Malware infected apps from its Play Store**                   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full article: [https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/96295/malware/joker-malware-actiity.html](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/96295/malware/joker-malware-actiity.html)

Excerpt:

Google revealed it successfully removed more than 1,700 apps from the Play Store over the past three years that had been infected with the Joker malware.

Google provided technical details of its activity against the [Joker malware](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/90937/malware/joker-spyware-play-store.html) (aka Bread) operation during the last few years.

The Joker malware is a malicious code camouflaged as a system app and allows attackers to perform a broad range of malicious operations, including disable the [Google Play Protect service](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/59309/mobile-2/google-play-protect.html), install malicious apps, generate fake reviews, and show ads.

The spyware is able to steal SMS messages, contact lists and device information along with to sign victims up for premium service subscriptions.

In October, Google has [removed](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/90937/malware/joker-spyware-play-store.html) from Google Play 24 apps because they were infected with Joker malware, the 24 malicious apps had a total of 472,000 installs.

_“Over the past couple of weeks, we have been observing a new Trojan on GooglePlay. So far, we have detected it in 24 apps with over 472,000+ installs in total.”_ 

_apps typically fall into two categories: SMS fraud (older versions) and toll fraud (newer versions). Both of these types of fraud take advantage of mobile billing techniques involving the user’s carrier.” reads the_ [_post_](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/01/pha-family-highlights-bread-and-friends.html) _published by Google._

The newer versions of the Joker malware were involved in toll fraud that consist of tricking victims into subscribing to or purchasing various types of content via their mobile phone bill.

**Over 25,000 Citrix (NetScaler) endpoints vulnerable to CVE-2019-19781**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full Article: [https://badpackets.net/over-25000-citrix-netscaler-endpoints-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-19781/](https://badpackets.net/over-25000-citrix-netscaler-endpoints-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-19781/)

Excerpt:

On Friday, January 10, 2020, our honeypots detected opportunistic mass scanning activity originating from a host in Germany targeting Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway (also known as NetScaler Gateway) servers vulnerable to [CVE-2019-19781](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781). This critical vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute commands on the targeted server after chaining an arbitrary file read/write (directory traversal) flaw.

#### **What type of organizations are affected by CVE-2019-19781?**  _(industries with typically poor or outdated security practices… --brbr)_

4,576 unique autonomous systems (network providers) were found to have vulnerable Citrix endpoints on their network. We’ve discovered this vulnerability currently affects:

-   **Military, federal, state, and city government agencies**

-   Public universities and schools

-   Hospitals and healthcare providers

-   Electric utilities and cooperatives

-   Major financial and banking institutions

-   Numerous Fortune 500 companies

#### How is CVE-2019-19781 exploited and what is the risk?

This critical vulnerability is easy for attackers to exploit using publicly available proof-of-concept code. Various methods demonstrating how to exploit CVE-2019-19781 have been posted on GitHub by [Project Zero India](https://github.com/projectzeroindia/CVE-2019-19781) and [TrustedSec](https://github.com/trustedsec/cve-2019-19781). A forensic guide is available detailing [how to check](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/netscaler-remote-code-execution-forensics/?utm_content=112033384&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-403811306) Citrix servers for evidence of a compromise.

Further exploitation of this vulnerability could be used to spread ransomware (similar to [CVE-2019-11510](https://badpackets.net/over-14500-pulse-secure-vpn-endpoints-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-11510/)) and cryptocurrency mining malware on sensitive networks. If multiple servers are compromised by the same threat actor, they could be weaponized for coordinated malicious activity such as [DDoS](https://badpackets.net/botnet-c2-detections/) attacks.

SNAKE #Ransomware Targets Entire Corporate Systems?
---------------------------------------------------

Full Article: [https://www.ehackingnews.com/2020/01/snake-ransomware-targets-entire.html](https://www.ehackingnews.com/2020/01/snake-ransomware-targets-entire.html) 

Excerpt:

The new Snake Ransomware family sets out to target the organizations’' corporate networks in all their entirety, written in Golang and containing a significant level of obfuscation, the observations and disclosure for the attacks were made by a group of security specialists from the MalwareHunterTeam.

The Ransomware upon successful infection subsequently erases the machine's Shadow Volume Copies before ending different processes related to SCADA frameworks, network management solutions, virtual machines, and various other tools.

After that, it continues to encrypt the machine's files while skirting significant Windows folders and system files. As a feature of this procedure, it affixes "EKANS" as a file marker alongside a five-character string to the file extension of each file it encrypts. The threat wraps up its encryption routine by dropping a ransom note entitled "Fix-Your-Files.txt" in the C:\\Users\\Public\\Desktop folder, which instructs victims to contact "bapcocrypt@ctemplar.com" so as to purchase a decryption tool.
