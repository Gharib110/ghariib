# Stop and think before you click that link

<br/>

<br/>
We've got followup from a listener on cognitive dissonance and behavioral science. Dave shares a listener story about a University Dean's List scam. Joe shares statistics from a government agency phishing test. Our catch of the day involves funds from the FBI, the IMF, and yes, Nigeria. Dave interviews Crane Hassold from Agari with phishing trends they've been tracking, plus his experiences as a former FBI agent. Links to stories in today's show: https://fcw.com/articles/2019/02/11/cyber-phishing-oig-fhfa.aspx Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share?
