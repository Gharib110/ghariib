We postponed the DEF CON China 2 event, hoping we'd be able to pick another date in 2020. Sadly, even now in mid-June we have too many unresolved concerns to go forward. We're cancelling DEF CON China 2, but we're hopeful we can return to Beijing in 2021. You can read DT's [blog post](https://forum.defcon.org/node/232747) about it in the DEF CON forums.
