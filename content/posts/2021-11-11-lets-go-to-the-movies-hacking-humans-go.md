# Lets go to the movies Hacking Humans Goes to the Movies

<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to a fun new project by the team who brings you Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Co-hosts Dave Bittner and Joe Carrigan are joined by Rick Howard in this series. They view clips from their favorite movies with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear about on Hacking Humans. In this first episode, Dave, Joe and Rick are watching Dave's and Joe's picks. They watch each of the selected scenes, describe the on-screen action for you, and then the team deconstructs what they saw. Grab your popcorn and join us for a trip to the movies. Links to movie clips if you'd like to watch along: Dave's pick from "The Grifters" Joe's clip from "Matchstick Men"
