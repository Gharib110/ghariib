# The Malware Mash

<br/>

<br/>
Happy Halloween from the team at N2K Networks! We hope you share in our Halloween tradition of listening to the Malware Mash. You can check out our video here. Lyrics I was coding in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight  for my malware threat score began to rise  and suddenly to my surprise... It did the Mash  It did the Malware Mash  The Malware Mash  It was a botnet smash  It did the Mash  It caught on 'cause of Flash  The Malware Mash  It did the Malware Mash From the Stuxnet worm squirming toward the near east  to the dark web souqs where the script kiddies feast  the APTs left their humble abodes  to get installed from rootkit payloads.  They did the Mash  They did the Malware Mash  The Malware Mash  It was an adware smash  They did the Mash  It caught on 'cause of Flash  The Malware Mash  They did the Malware Mash The botnets were having fun  The DDoS had just begun  The viruses hit the darknet,  with ransomware yet to come.  The keys were logging, phishing emails abound,  Snowden on chains, backed by his Russian hounds.  The Shadow Brokers were about to arrive  with their vocal group, "The NotPetya Five." They did the Mash  They played the Malware Mash The Malware Mash  It was a botnet smash  They did the Mash  It caught on 'cause of Flash  The Malware Mash  They played the Malware Mash Somewhere in Moscow Vlad's voice did ring  Seems he was troubled by just one thing.  He opened a shell then shook his fist  and said, "Whatever happened to my Turla Trojan twist."  It's now the Mash  It's now the Malware Mash  The Malware Mash  And it's a botnet smash  It's now the Mash  It caught on 'cause of Flash  The Malware Mash  It's now the Malware Mash Now everything's cool, Vlad's a part of the band  And the Malware Mash is the hit of the land.  For you, defenders, this mash was meant to  when you get to my door, tell them Creeper sent you. Then you can Mash  Then you can Malware Mash  The Malware Mash  And be a botnet smash  It is the Mash  Don't you dare download Flash  The Malware Mash  Just do the Malware Mash
