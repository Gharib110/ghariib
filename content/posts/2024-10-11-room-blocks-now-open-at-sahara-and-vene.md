Good news, everyone! We’ve already got some discounted room blocks you can use to lock down your lodgings for DEF CON 33.  
  
DC33 doesn’t kick off until August 7, 2025, but that’s no reason to lollygag. If you’re a high-octane go-getter you already know how good it feels to get those To-Do items checked off early. If not, this is far enough ahead to forget you booked and give yourself a nice surprise when there’s one less thing to do at crunch time.  
  
You can book at the [Sahara](https://book.passkey.com/e/50911722) and the [Venetian](https://book.passkey.com/go/RDCON) now and get the DC33 ball rolling. We’ll keep you posted as additional options become available.  
  
We’re already 2 months closer to the next DEF CON. Be prepared.
