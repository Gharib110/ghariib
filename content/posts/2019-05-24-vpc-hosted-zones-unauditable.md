# VPC Hosted Zones unauditable

<br/>

<br/>
For 6 years, it was not possible to see what hosted zones an attacker may have created in an account. This issue could be viewed as a business decision that adding the ability to viewing this data was not worthwhile, but the delay is significant and would allow someone that had compromised an environment to maintain a backdoor.
