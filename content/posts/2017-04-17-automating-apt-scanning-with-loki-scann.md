# Automating APT Scanning with Loki Scanner and Splunk

<br/>

<br/>
One thing that I've been exploring lately is automating the large number of amazing open source security tools out in the world. One tool that has caught my interest is the [Loki APT scanner](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki) created by [BSK Consulting](http://bsk-consulting.de/), a cool scanner that combines filenames, IP addresses, domains, hashes, Yara rules, Regin file system checks, process anomaly checks, SWF decompressed scan, SAM dump checks, etc. to find indicators of compromise on your system. From the Loki github page, Loki currently includes the following IOC checks:  

-   Equation Group Malware (Hashes, Yara Rules by Kaspersky and 10 custom rules generated by us)
-   Carbanak APT - Kaspersky Report (Hashes, Filename IOCs - no service detection and Yara rules)
-   Arid Viper APT - Trendmicro (Hashes)
-   Anthem APT Deep Panda Signatures (not officialy confirmed) (krebsonsecurity.com - see Blog Post)
-   Regin Malware (GCHQ / NSA / FiveEyes) (incl. Legspin and Hopscotch)
-   Five Eyes QUERTY Malware (Regin Keylogger Module - see: Kaspesky Report)
-   Skeleton Key Malware (other state-sponsored Malware) - Source: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM)
-   WoolenGoldfish - (SHA1 hashes, Yara rules) Trendmicro Report
-   OpCleaver (Iranian APT campaign) - Source: Cylance
-   More than 180 hack tool Yara rules - Source: APT Scanner THOR
-   More than 600 web shell Yara rules - Source: APT Scanner THOR
-   Numerous suspicious file name regex signatures - Source: APT Scanner THOR
-   Much more ... (cannot update the list as fast as I include new signatures)

The challenge with Loki is that it can be very laborious to run and parse Loki's scan results across an enterprise to find the needle in a haystack . In this post we'll show how to write a Splunk app to automate running Loki, parsing the results, and identifying what is important. But as an FYI, Loki is a CLI-based program that has the ability to scan a folder, your system, etc. for possible indicators of compromise. Basic Loki commands are:  

```
usage: loki.exe [-h] [-p path] [-s kilobyte] [-l log-file] [-a alert-level]
                [-w warning-level] [-n notice-level] [--printAll]
                [--allreasons] [--noprocscan] [--nofilescan] [--noindicator]
                [--reginfs] [--dontwait] [--intense] [--csv] [--onlyrelevant]
                [--nolog] [--update] [--debug]    

Loki - Simple IOC Scanner    

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -p path           Path to scan
  -s kilobyte       Maximum file size to check in KB (default 2048 KB)
  -l log-file       Log file
  -a alert-level    Alert score
  -w warning-level  Warning score
  -n notice-level   Notice score
  --printAll        Print all files that are scanned
  --allreasons      Print all reasons that caused the score
  --noprocscan      Skip the process scan
  --nofilescan      Skip the file scan
  --noindicator     Do not show a progress indicator
  --reginfs         Do check for Regin virtual file system
  --dontwait        Do not wait on exit
  --intense         Intense scan mode (also scan unknown file types and all
                    extensions)
  --csv             Write CSV log format to STDOUT (machine prcoessing)
  --onlyrelevant    Only print warnings or alerts
  --nolog           Don't write a local log file
  --update          Update the signatures from the "signature-base" sub
                    repository
  --debug           Debug output
```

Before we begin with the steps to create the Splunk app, download the latest Loki Windows binary from [here](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/releases). For the sake of this blog post we will only be focusing on running Loki in Windows, but the functionality can easily be extended to all operating systems. Once downloaded, run the command "_loki.exe --update_" to download the latest IOC files into the folder "_signature-base_" that will be used later.  
  
On a side note, if you would like to further update your IOCs to include Alienware malicious IPs and domains and [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/) IOCs, use the signature update files located in "_signature-base\\threatintel_". You will require an API key from [Alienvault Open Threat Exchange](https://otx.alienvault.com/api/) (OTX), and a MISP API key from a running [MISP instance](http://www.misp-project.org/communities/). The AlienVault API key is easy to get, the MISP instance is a little more difficult. In any case, once you have your keys you can write a script that updates either or both services and schedule a Cron job with the following commands:  

```
# Update AlienVault OTX:
  python get-otx-iocs.py -k <API_KEY>

# Update MISP:
  python get-misp-iocs.py -k <API_KEY> -u <URL>
```

Now that we have an updated Loki executable and signatures we are ready to create the Splunk App directory structure. In your Splunk Deployment Server create the following directories and files:  

```
The following 
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/Splunk_App_loki
├── bin
|   
```

Now that we have our directory structure, there are a couple of default files that will need to be created that we'll run through quickly:  
1) **$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\_App\_loki\\bin\\signature-base\\\***  

\# Copy the folder and its content created via the command "_loki.exe --update_"to the specified folder.

2) **$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\_App\_loki\\bin\\config\\**[excludes.cfg](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/blob/master/config/excludes.cfg)  
This is actually a Loki default file, but should be included none the less.  

\# Excluded directories
#
# Ensure that you have the latest file from the excludes.cfg URL above.
#
# - add directories you want to exclude from the scan
# - double escape back slashes
# - values are case-insensitive
# - remember to use back slashes on Windows and slashes on Linux / Unix / OSX
# - each line contains a regex that matches somewhere in the full path (case insensitive)
#   e.g.:
#   Regex: \\\\System32\\\\
#   Matches C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe
#
#   Regex: /var/log/\[^/\]+\\.log
#   Matches: /var/log/test.log
#   Not Matches: /var/log/test.gz
#

# Useful examples (google "antivirus exclusion recommendations" to find more)
\\\\Ntfrs\\\\
\\\\Ntds\\\\

**_$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\_App\_loki\\default\\[app.conf](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Appconf)_**  
The app.conf file maintains the state of a given app in Splunk Enterprise. It may also be used to customize certain aspects of an app.  

\## Splunk app configuration file

\[install\]
is\_configured = true
state = enabled

\[launcher\]
author = epicism
version = 1.0
description = Technology Add-on for the Loki APT Scanner

\[ui\]
is\_visible = false
label = Technology Add-on for Loki APT Scanner

\[package\]
id = Splunk\_App\_loki

**_$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\_App\_loki\\metadata\\[default.meta](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Defaultmetaconf)_**  
The default.meta file contain ownership information, access controls, and export settings for Splunk objects like saved searches, event types, and views. Each app has its own default.meta file.  

\[\]
access = read : \[\*\], write: \[ admin \]
export = system

Now that we have the default files out of the way we can create the Loki-specific configuration files. First is the inputs.conf file that runs the script that executes the loki.exe binary and reads the loki scan results.

  

**_$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\__****_App_****_\_loki\\default\\[inputs.conf](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Inputsconf)_**  
The inputs.conf file contains possible settings you can use to configure inputs, distributed inputs such as forwarders, and file system monitoring in inputs.conf.  

\# This is where you would place your signature update script if you created it:
# \[script://$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\apps\\loki\\bin\\signature-base\\threatintel\\updateintel.bat\]
# disabled = true
# index = main
# interval = 30 1 \* \* \*
# sourcetype = lokirun

# This entry runs the loki batch script and sends the script output to a null index.
# I could not get loki.exe's output to be ingested by Splunk when running it from this script,
# so I routed loki.exe's output to the $SPLUNK\_HOME\\...\\loki.log in the next stanza.
\[script://$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\apps\\Splunk\_App\_loki\\bin\\loki.bat\]
disabled = false
index = main
interval = 0 0 2 \* \* ?
sourcetype = lokirun
queueSize = 50MB

# The loki.bat batch script will save the loki.exe output to $SPLUNK\_HOME\\var\\log\\loki.log, and this reads it.
\[monitor://$SPLUNK\_HOME\\var\\log\\splunk\\loki.log\]
disabled = false
index = loki
sourcetype = loki

**_$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\__****_App_****_\_loki\\bin\\loki.bat_**  
This script moves its current working directory to the location of the script, overwrites loki.log to ensure that it doesn't grow endlessly and runs loki.exe. "..\\..\\..\\..\\var\\log\\splunk\\" saves the output log in Splunk's log directory.  

cd /d %~dp0
> ..\\..\\..\\..\\var\\log\\splunk\\loki.log echo.
start /low /d "%~dp0" loki.exe --reginfs --csv --dontwait --onlyrelevant --noindicator --intense -l ..\\..\\..\\..\\var\\log\\splunk\\loki.log

The following files are the configuration files used by the Splunk Search Head to parse the Loki log files. The Loki log files are supposed to be CSV format, but only the first half of the values are, which required me to be creative when parsing the event logs. Props.conf will parse the first half of the properly CSV separated log, and transforms.conf parses the rest of the line.  
  
**_$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\__****_App_****_\_loki\\default\\[props.conf](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Propsconf)_**  
A little on Props.conf - it is commonly used for:  

-   Configuring line breaking for multi-line events;
-   Setting up character set encoding;
-   Allowing processing of binary files;
-   Configuring timestamp recognition;
-   Configuring event segmentation;
-   Overriding automated host and source type matching;
-   Configure advanced (regex-based) host and source type overrides;
-   Override source type matching for data from a particular source;
-   Set up rule-based source type recognition;
-   Rename source types;
-   And so on...

Props.conf is an integral part of a Splunk app, and I recommend that you read the props.conf description in the URL above if you're not familiar with it.

  

\# This is for data that we don't want ingested to Splunk
\[lokirun\]
DATETIME\_CONFIG = CURRENT
LINE\_BREAKER = (\[\\r\\n\]+)
SHOULD\_LINEMERGE = false
disabled = 0
TRANSFORMS-null= setnull

#This entry parses the loki.exe "CSV" output
\[loki\]
TIME\_PREFIX = ^
TIME\_FORMAT = %Y%m%dT%H:%M:%SZ
MAX\_TIMESTAMP\_LOOKAHEAD = 25
DATETIME\_CONFIG = CURRENT
LINE\_BREAKER = (\[\\r\\n\]+)
SHOULD\_LINEMERGE = false
disabled = 0

# EXTRACT-00-HEADER extracts the properly CSV values at the start of the log, and the REPORT-00-KEYVALUES transforms.conf entry parses the rest of the line.
EXTRACT-00-HEADER = ^(?<DATE>\\d+)T(?<TIME>\\d+:\\d+:\\d+)Z,(?<HOSTNAME>\[^,\]+),(?<SEVERITY>\[^,\]+),
# REPORT-00-KEYVALUES is responsible for parsing the remaining portion of the Loki event log not parsed by EXTRACT-00-HEADER. transforms.conf is good at parsing repeating values (such as "x=y" \* z patterns), which is how Loki outputs its scan results.
REPORT-00-KEYVALUES = trans\_keyvalues

**_$SPLUNK\_HOME\\etc\\deployment\_apps\\Splunk\__****_App_****_\_loki\\default\\[transforms.conf](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Transformsconf)_**  
A little on transforms.conf - it is commonly used for:  

-   Configuring regex-based host and source type overrides;
-   Anonymizing certain types of sensitive incoming data, such as credit card or social security numbers;
-   Routing specific events to a particular index, when you have multiple indexes;
-   Creating new index-time field extractions. NOTE: We do not recommend adding to the set of fields that are extracted at index time unless it is absolutely necessary because there are negative performance implications;
-   And a lot more...

Like props.conf, transforms.conf is an integral configuration file to an app and I recommend that you read up on the URL to better understand the configuration file's function.

  

\# This is supposed to remove Loki's process bar entries
\[setnull\]
REGEX = ^\[\\\\\\|\\-\\/\\b\]+$
DEST\_KEY = queue
FORMAT = nullQueue

# This removes the loki.exe execution entry
\[setnull2\]
REGEX = ^.\*?\\\\etc\\\\apps\\\\loki\\\\bin>loki\\.exe --reginfs --csv --dontwait --onlyrelevant --intense\\s+$
DEST\_KEY = queue
FORMAT = nullQueue

# "REGEX = XXX" parses the "key=value" pattern that isn't comma separated by performing a look ahead to detect the next "key=" entry. 
# FORMAT = $1::$2 tells Splunk that the key/value is to be formatted based on the first group that the regex extracts as the key, and the second group that the regex extracts as the value.
# Message me if you would like a deeper breakdown of how this works, and I would be happy to explain it.
\[trans\_keyvalues\]
REGEX = (\[\\w\\d\]+):\\s(.\*?)(?=((\\s\[\\d\\w\]+:\\s)|$))
FORMAT = $1::$2

And that's it! Simple, right? It may be overwhelming if you're new to Splunk apps, but the main thing that you should know is that inputs.conf runs loki.bat (that runs loki.exe) and monitors for the loki.log file to be updated with the scan results. props.conf parses the first half of the Loki event log, and transforms.conf parses the rest. Hopefully this is helpful, but if you need more information feel free to message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Epicism1) and I can provide more details.

  
Now we have a full app in your Splunk deployment server, re-deploy your deployment server apps using the command:  

$SPLUNK\_HOME/bin/splunk reload deploy-server

Now you should be able to see Splunk\_App\_loki in your Deployment server. Go to _Settings_ -> _Forwarder Management_ -> _Apps_, find **Splunk\_App\_loki** and click _**Edit**_.

_Note, if you chose to create the Splunk\_TA\_loki app, you can perform the same steps as above and add your search head to the clients list, or using the cluster manager._

  
In the Apps section select of the page click _Edit_ to take you to the App list page. Click on the **_Splunk\_App\_loki_** app in the left hand side list to add it to the app class and click **_Save_**:

This will take you back to the Loki\_App\_Class page. Next you will add the clients that you want to run the Loki APT scanner on. Click the **_Edit_** button on the Clients section of the page to take you to the list of clients (e.g. Splunk servers and Splunk Universal Forwarder servers). Add the Windows clients that you want to run Loki on on a regular schedule by adding their hostname to the _Include (whitelist)_ textbox and click the **_Save_** button:

This will cause the clients in the Include (whitelist) of the  Loki\_App\_Class to download, install and run the Loki app the next time they call in to the deployment server every day at 2:00 AM, save the results to "$SPLUNK\_HOME\\var\\log\\splunk\\loki.log" and then ingest and parse the results into Splunk, taking the following:

Loki Parsed Logs

**Conclusion**  
This is great, but, really, so what? What can we do with this information? The value in this post is in creating the ability to automate a manual task across your your enterprise. You no longer have to manually run the Loki APT scanner on each system across your environment and parse through the results for possible issues. Automate, explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate (if I'm getting my [references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X) correct). With a sea of open source security tools that work well on a manual process, this solution can be an excellent method to provide a fresh insight into the workings, and malevolent workings, of an enterprise.
