# 2017-014-Policy_writing_for_the_masses-master_fingerprints_and_shadowbrokers

<br/>

<br/>
So, I (Bryan) had a bit of a work issue to discuss. It has become one of my myriad jobs at work to write up some policies. In and of itself, it's not particularly fun work, and for whatever reason, this is causing me all kinds of issues. So this week we take a quick look at why I'm having these issues, if they are because I don't get it, or because the method I must follow is flawed.

After that, we add on to last week's show on #2FA and #MFA ([http://traffic.libsyn.com/brakeingsecurity/2017-013-Multi-factor\_auth\_gotchas\_with\_Matt.mp3](http://traffic.libsyn.com/brakeingsecurity/2017-013-Multi-factor_auth_gotchas_with_Matt.mp3)) by discussing why scientists are trying to create a 'master fingerprint' capable of opening mobile devices. We talk about FAR and FRR (false acceptance/rejection rates), and why the scientists may actually be able to pull it off.

We discussed Ms. Berlin's trip to the AIDE conference ([https://appyide.org/](https://appyide.org/)), a two day #DFIR conference held at Marshall University by our good friend Bill Gardner (@oncee on Twitter). She gave a great interactive talk on working through online wargames and CTFs, and we get her update on the conference.

Finally, we did discuss a bit about the #ShadowBroker dump of #NSA tools. We discussed how different people are taking this dump over the #Wikileaks #CIA dump.
