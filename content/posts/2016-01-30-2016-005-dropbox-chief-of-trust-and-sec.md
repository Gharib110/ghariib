# 2016-005-Dropbox Chief of Trust and Security Patrick Heim

<br/>

<br/>
Brakeing Down Security had the pleasure of having Patrick Heim join us to discuss a number of topics.

We discussed a number of topics:

Cloud migrations

What stops many traditional #companies from moving into #cloud based operations? What hurdles do they face, and what are some pitfalls that can hamper a successful #migration?

We touched briefly on #BYOD and the use of personal devices in a business environment, as well as #Dropbox's deployment of optional #2FA and using #U2F keys for additional #authentication measures.

Finally, as an established leader in several major #companies, we pick Mr. #Heim's brain about qualities of a leader. Can you self-diagnose if you'll be a good manager? And what does Mr. Heim look for when hiring qualified candidates.

It was a pleasure having Mr. Patrick Heim on and Brakeing Down #Security thanks him for his valuable time.

Some #articles we drew upon for questions to ask Mr. Heim:
