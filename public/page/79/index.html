	<div>
		<p>Researchers found that most of the apps available on Apple’s App Store leak at least one hard-coded secret.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at 156,000 iOS apps and discovered more than 815,000 hardcoded secrets, including very sensitive secrets like keys to cloud storage, various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and even payment processors.</p>
<p>The researchers noted how:</p>
<p>“The average app’s code exposes 5.2 secrets, and 71% of apps leak at least one secret.”</p>

		<p>During an Advanced Continual Threat Hunt (ACTH) investigation in early February 2025, Trustwave SpiderLabs discovered a resurgence of fake CAPTCHA verifications designed to deceive victims into executing malicious PowerShell scripts. This campaign employs a multi-stage PowerShell execution process, ultimately delivering infostealers such as Lumma and Vidar.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The recent breach of the United States Treasury underscores a stark reality: cyber adversaries are no longer just looking for gaps in traditional network security—they are actively exploiting the tools organizations rely on for daily operations. Remote assistance technologies, essential for IT support and business continuity, have become prime targets for credential theft, moving within the network, and system exploitation. The message is clear: securing remote assistance is no longer optional; it is a fundamental requirement for maintaining operational resilience.  </p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At Docker, we are committed to ensuring that Docker Hub remains the best place for developers, engineering teams, and operations teams to build, share, and collaborate. As part of this, we previously announced plans to introduce image pull consumption fees and storage-based billing. After further evaluating how developers use Docker Hub and what will best support the ecosystem, we have refined our approach—one that prioritizes developer experience and enables developers to scale with confidence while reinforcing Docker Hub as the foundation of the cloud-native ecosystem.</p>

<p>A piece of musical history is the Maplin 4600, a DIY electronic music synthesizer from the 1970s. The design was published in an Australian electronics magazine and sold as a DIY kit, and [LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER] got his hands on an original Maplin 4600 that he refurbishes and puts through its paces.</p>
