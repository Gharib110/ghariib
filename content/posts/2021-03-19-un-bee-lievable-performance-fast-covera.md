# Un-bee-lievable Performance Fast Coverage-guided Fuzzing with Honeybee and Intel Processor Trace

<br/>

<br/>
Today, we are releasing an experimental coverage-guided fuzzer called Honeybee that records program control flow using Intel Processor Trace (IPT) technology. Previously, IPT has been scrutinized for severe underperformance due to issues with capture systems and inefficient trace analyses. My winter internship focused on working through these challenges to make \[â€¦\]
