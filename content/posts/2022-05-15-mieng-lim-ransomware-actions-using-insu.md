Prepared questions from Mieng:

-   Belief that “malicious actors today are using cutting edge techniques for the majority of attacks”
-   Belief that “majority of compromises are via zero-day vulnerabilities”
-   Organizations continue to leave systems unpatched with years old vulnerabilities
-   Belief that “my organization doesn’t have anything a malicious actor would be interested in…I’m not a target”
-   My organization has cyber insurance and that’s enough.
-   “I don’t have budget to buy all the products/hire the staff needed to protect my network.”

As new approaches to ransomware like double extortion continue to pay off, attackers are [demanding higher ransom payouts](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/taxpayers-dollars-to-ransomware-attacks/) than ever before. The average ransom demand in the first half of 2021 amounted to [$5.3 million — a 518%](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-demands-surge-2021/) increase compared to 2020. The average ransom payment has also increased by 82% since 2020, reaching a whopping $570,000 in the first half of 2021 alone.

The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received 2,084 ransomware complaints in the first half of 2021. ([FBI and CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-243a))

At least one employee downloaded a malicious mobile application in 46% of organizations in 2021. (Check Point)
