A big update to the perennially popular GNOME Shell extension Dash to Panel is rolling out, including new settings to go from Dash to Panel to dock mode! Admittedly, that doesn’t sound like a new feature given that Dash to Panel is based on code from Dash to Dock. Yet, until now, those wanting the unified panel of Dash to Panel with the aesthetic of a dock… Had to make do with an inelegant fudge, or switch extension. No more; when whim and want demands a dynamic dock setup, Dash to Panel’s preferences area can help, making it easier to […]</p>

<p>The internet is brimming with content designed to entertain, inform—and sometimes deceive. The latest tool in a cybercriminal’s arsenal? Deepfakes. From fabricated celebrity endorsements to fraudulent job interviews, AI-generated deepfake scams are growing at an alarming rate. As deepfake technology becomes more advanced, it’s harder than ever to discern real from fake—until it’s too late. </p>
<p>According to McAfee’s latest “State of the Scamiverse” report, deepfake scams have become an everyday reality. The average American now encounters 2.6 deepfake videos daily, with younger adults (18-24) seeing even more – about 3.5 per day. And for less than the cost of a latte and in under 10 minutes, scammers today can create shockingly convincing deepfake videos of anyone: your mom, your boss, or even your child.</p>

		<p>Day One is now available on Windows and anyone can try it for free.</p>
<p>Journal apps on digital platforms are fairly popular, especially among people who want to keep a digitized record of their lives. A couple of years ago, Apple announced its built-in <strong>Journal</strong> app for iOS, entering a competitive market which already features the likes of Everlog, Obsidian, and Day One. If you&rsquo;re a customer of the last app mentioned in this list, you&rsquo;ll be happy to hear that the digital journal has now made its way to Windows.</p>

		<p>This is a cryptography blog and I always feel the need to apologize for any post that isn’t “straight cryptography.” I’m actually getting a little tired of apologizing for it (though if you want some hard-core cryptography content, there’s plenty here and here.)</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to remind my colleagues that out in the real world, our job is not to solve exciting mathematical problems: <em>it’s to help people communicate securely</em>. And people, at this very moment, need a lot of help. Many of my friends are Federal employees or work for contractors, and they’re terrified that they’re going to lose their job based on speech they post online. Unfortunately, “online” to many people includes thoughts sent over private text messages — so even private conversations are becoming chilled. And while this is hardly the worst thing happening to people in this world, it’s something that’s happening to my friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>The promise of cloud native applications lies in their ability to provide enhanced agility, scalability, and resilience, perfectly aligning with the digital transformation needs of today&rsquo;s enterprises. However, as we navigate this transformation, cloud native application security is often surrounded by myths and misconceptions. Understanding these myths and how they are being addressed is crucial for organizations to secure their environments effectively.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The generative AI (GenAI) landscape is evolving at breakneck speed, and with it, the challenges for enterprise security. DeepSeek’s R1 model, released on January 20, 2025, gained rapid popularity due to its high performance and cost-efficiency. It rivaled established AI models at a fraction of the cost. The open-source nature of DeepSeek also allowed AI developers to use it for free, contributing to its swift rise in app stores and industry rankings.</p>
