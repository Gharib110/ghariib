The first show of our 2018 season brings us something new (some awesome new additions to our repertoire), and something old (ransomware).

Michael Gough is joining us to discuss a new a partnership with BrakeSec Podcast (you'll have to listen to find out, or wait a few weeks :D )

We discuss #Spectre and #meltdown vulnerabilities, wonder about the criticality of the vulnerabilities and mitigation of them, and debate why the patching was handled in such a poor manner.

We also discuss a news story about a school that spent an exorbitant amount of money to remove a trojan that Mr. Boettcher (@boettcherpwned) and Mr. Gough (@hackerhurricane) believe to be very simply handled. We talk about the need for state and local governments and institutions to have a some way to call for breaches or 'cyber' crisis that would have a no-blame assistance helpline. 

I did a quick video, which has a demonstration of Dave Kennedy's security tool "Pentester Framework" (PTF). There's even a video of the demo on our Youtube Channel ([https://youtu.be/sIc1ljkwE5Q](https://youtu.be/sIc1ljkwE5Q))

Finally, we discuss our upcoming training with Ms. Berlin (@infosystir) "Disrupting the Cyber Kill Chain", which will start the first week of February and go for 4 weeks. More details next week!

Great if you work a job where you get called a lot

Less likely to have to get up during class and walk away…

  

Bit of a technical discussion - PTF (pentester framework)

Setup, install software

Lighter than Kali

Works on debian, ubuntu, pretty much any linux

  

Slack

Invite only

Slack bot died

A new link every month is a bit of a PITA

Being popular invites bots… would like to reduce that risk by broadcasting an invite

  

Friend of mine was invited to speak on “A man’s view of women in technology” O.o ([http://www.cmhwit.org/](http://www.cmhwit.org/))

“ John ---- Actually, my plan at this point is to interview several of the successful woman I know in technology, followed by personal observations of how I've seen them become well respected leaders in the field.”
