# Nagios XI 5510 XSS to

<br/>

<br/>
Tl;dr
-----

A remote attacker could trick an authenticated victim (with “autodiscovery job” creation privileges) to visit a malicious URL and obtain a remote root shell via a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) and a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE).

Introduction
------------

A few months ago I read about [some Nagios XI vulnerabilities](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/rooting-nagios-via-outdated-libraries-bb79427172) which got me interested in studying it a bit by myself. For those of you who don’t know what Nagios XI is I suggest you have a look [at their website](https://www.nagios.com/products/nagios-xi/).
