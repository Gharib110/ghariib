DEF CON will always be a cash-at-the-door conference. We will always honor the LineCon with pizza and beachballs. This is the way.  
  
However, the online option we introduced at DC Safe Mode has proven quite popular. It seems a lot of you appreciate the convenience of pre-registration so weâ€™re keeping it for DEF CON 31. [Tickets are available now at shop.defcon.org](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-31-pre-registration-ticket), BYOP(izza).
