# Special Interview with Johnny Long

<br/>

<br/>
At DerbyCon last year, Mr. Boettcher did a microcast with Johnny Long. An inspirational human being who left a life many info professionals dream of, and went to Africa to help disadvantaged people make a better life with access to technology.

Where is the audio you ask? Well, we've posted it on out Patreon so that they can have first dibs on it. We'll post it here this weekend for everyone.Â 

He is a great individual and we hope you'll enjoy it.
