# How political donations can be deceiving

<br/>

<br/>
Maria Varmazis, host of N2K's daily space show T-Minus, joins Dave and Joe to share the story of a relentless wave of political donation texts that go well beyond simple annoyance, revealing an unsettling impact on vulnerable populations. CNN's investigation exposes how these texts, with their urgent and personal tone, have led seniors, including those with dementia, to make thousands of donationsâ€”sometimes unknowingly amassing hundreds of thousands of dollars for campaigns. Joe's story highlights a dash cam video capturing a car colliding with another vehicle while backing up on a busy highway. The footage raises questions about driver awareness and road safety in high-traffic situations. Dave's story shares the alarming potential of OpenAI's real-time voice API, which allows scammers to create AI agents capable of executing phone scams for as little as $0.75. Researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign revealed that these agents can autonomously conduct scams, raising serious concerns about the misuse of voice-enabled AI technology despite previous safety precautions. And finally, our catch of the day shares how the Library of Congress is cracking down on copy write infringement. Links to the stories: Age of fraud: Are seniors more vulnerable to financial scams?
