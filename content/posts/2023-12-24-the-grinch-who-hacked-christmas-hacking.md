Thanks for joining us again for another episode of a fun project brought to you by the team of Hacking Humans, the CyberWire's social engineering podcast. Hacking Humans co-host Dave Bittner is joined by Rick Howard in this series where they view clips from their favorite movies and television shows with examples of the social engineering scams and schemes you hear Dave and co-host Joe Carrigan talk about on Hacking Humans. In this episode, Dave and Rick watch some holiday classics, describe the on-screen action for you, and then they deconstruct what they saw. Grab your Christmas cookies and join us for some fantastic scams and frauds. Links to this episode's clips if you'd like to watch along: How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Cartoon) The Greening of theÂ Grinch (magazine)
