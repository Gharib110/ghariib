# 2016-047 Inserting Security into the SDLC finding Privilege Escalation in poorly configured Linux systems

<br/>

<br/>
Just a quick episode this week...

As part of the Brakesec Book Club (join us on our #Slack Channel for more information!) we are discussing Dr. Gary McGraw's book "Software Security: Building Security In" (Amazon Link: [https://is.gd/QtHQcM)](https://is.gd/QtHQcM\))

We talk about the need to inserting security into your company's #SDLC... but what exactly can be done to enable that? I talk about abuse cases, #risk #analysis, creating test cases, pentesting, and #security #operations are all methods to do so.

Finally, I discovered a blog talking about ways to discover configuration errors on Linux systems that might allow #privilege #escalation to occur. Using these tools as part of your hardening processes could lower the risk of a bad actor gaining elevated privileges on your \*unix hosts
