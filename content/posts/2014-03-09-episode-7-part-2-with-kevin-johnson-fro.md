# Episode 7 Part 2 with Kevin Johnson from SecureIdeas

<br/>

<br/>
This is the Part 2 of our Interview with Kevin Johnson.  During our interview, we followed him down the rabbit hole.  We learned how to default rulesets in ANY rules based hardware solution sucks.  We learned that being a security professional is more than just a fancy title.  And finally, we learned that Kevin is a huge fan of Star Wars.
