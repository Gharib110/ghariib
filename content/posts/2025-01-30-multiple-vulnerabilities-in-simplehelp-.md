# Multiple Vulnerabilities in SimpleHelp RMM Could Allow for Arbitrary Code Execution

<br/>

<br/>
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleHelp RMM that could allow for arbitrary code execution. SimpleHelp is a popular remote access software. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities when chained together could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
