# The Brussels Defect Too Early is Worse Than Too Late Plus Mark MacCarthys Book on Regulating Digital Industries

<br/>

<br/>
That, at least, is what I hear from my VC friends in Silicon Valley. And they wouldn’t get an argument this week from EU negotiators facing what looks like a third rewrite of the much-too -early AI Act. [Mark MacCarthy](https://cbpp.georgetown.edu/people/mark-maccarthy/) explains that negotiations over an overhaul of the act demanded by France and Germany [led to a walkout by EU parliamentarians](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eus-ai-act-negotiations-hit-the-brakes-over-foundation-models/). The cause? In their enthusiasm for screwing American AI companies, the drafters inadvertently screwed a French and a German AI aspirant

Mark is also our featured author for an interview about his book, ["Regulating Digital Industries: How Public Oversight Can Encourage Competition, Protect Privacy, and Ensure Free Speech"](https://www.amazon.com/Regulating-Digital-Industries-Oversight-Competition-ebook/dp/B0C4GDTNDZ) I offer to blurb it as “an entertaining, articulate and well-researched book that is egregiously wrong on almost every page.” Mark promises that at least part of my blurb will make it to his website. I highly recommend it to Cyberlaw listeners who mostly disagree with me – a big market, I’m told.

[Kurt Sanger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurt-sanger-311970115/) reports on what looks like another myth about Russian cyberwarriors – that they can’t coordinate with kinetic attacks to produce a combined effect. Mandiant says that’s exactly what [Sandworm hackers did in Russia’s most recent attack on Ukraine’s grid](https://www.wired.com/story/sandworm-ukraine-third-blackout-cyberattack/).

[Adam Hickey](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/h/adam-hickey?tab=overview), meanwhile, reports on a lawsuit over internet sex that [drove an entire social media platform out of business](https://www.wired.com/story/omegle-shutdown-lawsuit-child-sexual-abuse/). Meanwhile, Meta [is getting beat up](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/tech/meta-ignored-warnings-instagrams-harm/) on the Hill and in the [press](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/07/meta-discord-and-others-unveil-effort-to-combat-online-child-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse/) for failing to protect teens from sexual and other harms. I ask the obvious question: Who the heck is trying to get naked pictures of Facebook’s core demographic?

Mark explains the latest [EU rules on targeted political ads](https://www.reuters.com/technology/big-tech-face-tougher-rules-targeted-political-ads-eu-2023-11-07/) – which consist of several perfectly reasonable provisions combined with a couple designed to cut the heart out of online political advertising. 

Adam and I puzzle over why the FTC is telling the U.S. Copyright Office that [AI companies are a bunch of pirates who need to be pulled up short](https://venturebeat.com/ai/ftc-takes-shots-at-ai-in-rare-filing-to-us-copyright-office/). I point out that copyright is a multi-generational monopoly on written works. Maybe, I suggest, the FTC has finally combined its unfairness and its anti-monopoly authorities to protect copyright monopolists from the unfairness of Fair Use. Taking an indefensible legal position out of blind hatred for tech companies? Now that I think about it, that is kind of on-brand for Lina Khan’s FTC. 

Adam and I disagree about how seriously to take press claims that [AI generates images that are biased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/?itid=hp-more-top-stories_p006_f004&utm_source=pocket_saves). I complain about the reverse: AI that keeps pretending that there are a lot of black and female judges on the European Court of Justice.  

Kurt and Adam reprise the risk to [CISOs from the SEC's SolarWinds complaint](https://www.darkreading.com/operations/cisos-beware-secs-solarwinds-action-shows-theyre-scapegoating-us) – and all the dysfunctional things companies and CISOs will soon be doing to save themselves.

In updates and quick hits: 

-   Adam and I flag some [useful new report](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2023/11/06/documents_shed_new_light_on_feds_collusion_with_private_actors_to_police_speech_on_social_media_990672.html?mc_cid=95df7f830c&mc_eid=fba478624c&utm_source=pocket_saves)s from Congress on the [disinformation excesses of 2020](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/EIP_Jira_Ticket_Staff_Report_11-6-23_Clean.pdf?utm_source=pocket_saves). We both regret the fact that those excesses now make it unlikely the U.S. will do much about foreign government attempts to influence the 2024 election. 
    
-   I mourn the fact that we won’t be covering Susannah Gibson again. Gibson raised campaign funds by [doing literally what most politicians only do metaphorically](https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2023/11/08/insanity-wrap-amateur-pr0n-star-goes-down-in-virginia-n4923730?utm_source=pocket_saves). She has, gone down to defeat in her Virginia legislative race. 
    
-   In Cyberlaw Podcast alumni news, Alex Stamos and Chris Krebs have sold their consulting firm to [SentinelOne. They will only be allowed back on the podcast if they bring the Gulfstream.](https://therecord.media/sentinelone-to-acquire-krebs-stamos-group)  
    
-   I also note that Congress is finally starting to put some bills to renew section 702 of FISA into the hopper. Unfortunately, the first such [bill](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/government_surveillance_reform_act_of_2023_bill_text.pdf?utm_source=pocket_saves), a merger of left and right extremes called the Government Surveillance Reform Act, probably [should have gone into the chipper](https://therecord.media/bipartisan-legislation-congress-renew-overhaul-surveillance-section-702) instead.
