# Part 2 with Georgia Weidman

<br/>

<br/>
It only gets better in Part 2 of our Interview with Georgia Weidman, Author, Security Researcher and Creator of the Smartphone Pentesting Framework.

She talks about how people underestimate the mobile platform for pentesting purposes, and we even find out that in addition to Teaching a class on exploit development at BlackHat this year, she's going to be helping a great organization overseas.

We also got her talking about some do's and don'ts of pentesting! ;)

Please enjoy!
