# CVE-2021-40875 Improper Access Control in Gurock TestRail versions 7203014 results in sensitive file exposure

<br/>

<br/>
Credits John Github: https://github.com/johnjhacking SickCodes Twitter: https://twitter.com/sickcodes Identification During research, I stumbled upon a TestRail application. While using Burp Suite to look at various requests and responses of the application, I noticed a files.md5 path: It seemed fairly normal at first, until I saw how massive the list was: I attempted to try some of the paths, and was forbidden from accessing a lot of them. When I found a few paths that worked, I realized that I would need a better solution to check all of the paths.
