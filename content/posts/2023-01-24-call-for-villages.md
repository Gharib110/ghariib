Got a passion that you want to share with the DEF CON Community? Have ideas on how to make your favorite subject accessible and interactive? There may be a Village in your future. If your idea wins the day, we’ll work with you to make it a DC31 reality. [The rules and info are here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-cfv.html) and the clock is ticking. We’re excited to see what’s on your minds.
