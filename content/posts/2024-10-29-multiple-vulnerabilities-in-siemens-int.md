# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Siemens InterMesh Subscriber Devices Could Allow for Remote Code Execution

<br/>

<br/>
Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Siemens InterMesh Subscriber Devices, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. InterMesh leverages mesh radio technology and hardened alarm monitoring panels to create a private, self-healing network that delivers alarm signals. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.
