# Part 2 with Jarrod Frates - how pentesting is important

<br/>

<br/>
Part 2 of our interview with Jarrod Frates (FRAY-tes). We ask him about the value that a pentest can create, the way that that 'perfect' pentest can change culture and help create dialogue.

Also, we talk about how to take your automated testing info and then shift gears to manual testing... when to stop doing automated testing, and do the manual testing.

Hope you enjoy, have a great week!
