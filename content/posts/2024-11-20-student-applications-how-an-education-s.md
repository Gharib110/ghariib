UpGuard can now report that a public Google Cloud Storage bucket containing approximately 1.5 terabytes of data used to administer funding programs for college students has been secured. The bucket belonged to SmarterSelect, a company that provides software for managing the application process for scholarships, grants, and awards. The more than 2.8 million files included documents like transcripts, resumes, personal essays, tax returns, and invoices for approximately 1.2 million applications to funding programs.
