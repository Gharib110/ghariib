[Very cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqFb92qc14Q&feature=youtu.be) about the kind of crazy effort people put in to the #defcon Badge Hacking contest. Spoofing the badge is always a mighty challenge - but this team went above and beyond.

#urinalcake #badgelife thanks to @alexchaveriat for making the video!
