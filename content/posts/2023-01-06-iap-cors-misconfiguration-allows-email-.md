# IAP CORS Misconfiguration Allows Email Disclosure

<br/>

<br/>
A CORS misconfiguration in Google Cloud's Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) could have allowed attackers to disclose the email address of an authenticated user in websites protected by IAP, by convincing the user to connect to an attacker-controlled domain. This vulnerability enabled attackers to exploit CORS settings to access sensitive email information of both authenticated and unauthenticated users (with the latter requiring additional social engineering).
