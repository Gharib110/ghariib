# Python String Concatenation Techniques Examples and Tips

<br/>

<br/>
### [Introduction](#introduction)[](#introduction)

String concatenation is a fundamental operation in Python used to combine two or more strings into a single string. There are multiple ways to concatenate strings, each with different performance implications and use cases. This guide explores various techniques, their efficiency, and best practices to optimize string operations in Python.

This tutorial is aimed to explore different ways to concatenate strings in Python.

We can perform string concatenation in the following ways:

-   [Using `+` operator](/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation#string-concatenation-using-operator)
-   [Using `join()` method](/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation#string-concatenation-using-join-function)
-   [Using `%` operator](/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation#string-concatenation-using-the-operator)
-   [Using `format()` function](/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation#string-concatenation-using-format-function)
-   [Using f-string](/community/tutorials/python-string-concatenation#string-concatenation-using-f-string) (Literal String Interpolation)

[String Concatenation using `+` Operator](#string-concatenation-using-operator)[](#string-concatenation-using-operator)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the most simple way of string concatenation. Let’s look at a simple example.

```
s1 = 'Apple'
s2 = 'Pie'
s3 = 'Sauce'

s4 = s1 + s2 + s3

print(s4)
```

Output: `ApplePieSauce` Let’s look at another example where we will get two strings from user input and concatenate them.

```
s1 = input('Please enter the first string:\n')
s2 = input('Please enter the second string:\n')

print('Concatenated String =', s1 + s2)
```

Output:

```
Please enter the first string:
Hello
Please enter the second string:
World
Concatenated String = HelloWorld
```

![python string concatenation](https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2018/10/python-string-concatenation.png) It’s very easy to use + operator for string concatenation. However, the arguments must be a string.

```
>>>'Hello' + 4
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in 
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

We can use [str() function](/community/tutorials/python-str-repr-functions) to get the string representation of an object. Let’s see how to concatenate a string to integer or another object.

```
print('Hello' + str(4))


class Data:
    id = 0

    def __init__(self, i):
        self.id = i

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Data[' + str(self.id) + ']'


print('Hello ' + str(Data(10)))
```

Output:

```
Hello4
Hello Data[10]
```

The biggest issue with `+` operator is that we can’t add any separator or delimiter between strings. For example, if we have to concatenate “Hello” and “World” with a whitespace separator, we will have to write it as `"Hello" + " " + "World"`.

[String concatenation using `join()` function](#string-concatenation-using-join-function)[](#string-concatenation-using-join-function)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can use [join() function](/community/tutorials/python-join-list) to concatenate string with a separator. It’s useful when we have a sequence of strings, for example [list](/community/tutorials/understanding-lists-in-python-3) or [tuple](/community/tutorials/understanding-tuples-in-python-3) of strings. If you don’t want a separator, then use join() function with an empty string.

```
s1 = 'Hello'
s2 = 'World'

print('Concatenated String using join() =', "".join([s1, s2]))

print('Concatenated String using join() and whitespaces =', " ".join([s1, s2]))
```

Output:

```
Concatenated String using join() = HelloWorld
Concatenated String using join() and spaces = Hello World
```

[String Concatenation using the `%` Operator](#string-concatenation-using-the-operator)[](#string-concatenation-using-the-operator)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can use `%` operator for string formatting, it can be used for string concatenation too. It’s useful when we want to concatenate strings and perform simple formatting.

```
s1 = 'Hello'
s2 = 'World'

s3 = "%s %s" % (s1, s2)
print('String Concatenation using % Operator =', s3)

s3 = "%s %s from JournalDev - %d" % (s1, s2, 2018)
print('String Concatenation using % Operator with Formatting =', s3)
```

Output:

```
String Concatenation using % Operator = Hello World
String Concatenation using % Operator with Formatting = Hello World from JournalDev - 2018
```

[String Concatenation using `format()` function](#string-concatenation-using-format-function)[](#string-concatenation-using-format-function)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can use [string format() function](/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3) for string concatenation and formatting too.

```
s1 = 'Hello'
s2 = 'World'

s3 = "{}-{}".format(s1, s2)
print('String Concatenation using format() =', s3)

s3 = "{in1} {in2}".format(in1=s1, in2=s2)
print('String Concatenation using format() =', s3)
```

Output:

```
String Concatenation using format() = Hello-World
String Concatenation using format() = Hello World
```

Python String `format()` function is very powerful and useful when working with dynamic strings and variables.

[String Concatenation using f-string](#string-concatenation-using-f-string)[](#string-concatenation-using-f-string)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using Python 3.6+, you can use f-string for string concatenation too. It’s a new way to format strings and introduced in [PEP 498 - Literal String Interpolation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/).

```
s1 = 'Hello'
s2 = 'World'

s3 = f'{s1} {s2}'
print('String Concatenation using f-string =', s3)

name = 'Pankaj'
age = 34
d = Data(10)

print(f'{name} age is {age} and d={d}')
```

Output:

```
String Concatenation using f-string = Hello World
Pankaj age is 34 and d=Data[10]
```

Python f-string is cleaner and easier to write when compared to `format()` function. It also calls `str()` function when an object argument is used as field replacement.

[Using `+=` Operator](#using-operator)[](#using-operator)
---------------------------------------------------------

The `+=` operator appends a string to an existing string.

```
text = "Hello"
text += " World"
print(text)  # Output: Hello World
```

This method creates a new string in memory each time, making it inefficient for large-scale concatenation in loops.

[Some Practical Use Cases](#some-practical-use-cases)[](#some-practical-use-cases)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Concatenating User Input Strings](#concatenating-user-input-strings)[](#concatenating-user-input-strings)

When working with user input, it’s common to need to concatenate strings to form a complete piece of information. In this example, we’re asking the user to input their first and last names, and then combining them into a single string to display their full name.

```
first_name = input("Enter first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter last name: ")
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Full Name:", full_name)
```

### [Building Dynamic Strings for File Paths](#building-dynamic-strings-for-file-paths)[](#building-dynamic-strings-for-file-paths)

When working with file paths, it’s essential to ensure that the path is correctly formatted for the operating system being used. The `os.path.join()` function helps in dynamically building file paths by correctly inserting the appropriate directory separator for the current operating system. This approach ensures that the code is portable across different platforms.

```
import os
folder = "documents"
filename = "report.txt"
filepath = os.path.join(folder, filename)
print(filepath)  # Output: documents/report.txt
```

### [Handling Lists or Sequences Efficiently](#handling-lists-or-sequences-efficiently)[](#handling-lists-or-sequences-efficiently)

When dealing with lists or sequences of strings, it’s often necessary to concatenate them into a single string. The `join()` method is an efficient way to do this, especially when working with large lists. It allows you to specify a delimiter to separate the elements in the list, making it easy to format the output string as needed.

```
words = ["Python", "is", "efficient"]
result = " ".join(words)
print(result)  # Output: Python is efficient
```

[Memory Implications of Different Methods](#memory-implications-of-different-methods)[](#memory-implications-of-different-methods)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory Efficiency

`+` and `+=`

Low (Creates new string objects)

`join()`

High (Constructs final string in one go)

f-strings and `format()`

Moderate (Creates intermediate objects, optimized in modern Python)

[Conclusion](#conclusion)[](#conclusion)
----------------------------------------

Python String formatting can be done in several ways. Use them based on your requirements. If you have to concatenate a sequence of strings with a delimited, then use the join() function. If some formatting is also required with concatenation, then use the format() function or f-string. Note that f-string can be used with Python 3.6 or above versions. You can also learn more about [python list concatenation](/community/tutorials/concatenate-lists-python).
