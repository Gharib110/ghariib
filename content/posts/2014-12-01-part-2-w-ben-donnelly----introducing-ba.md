# Part 2 w Ben Donnelly -- Introducing Ball and Chain making password breaches a thing of the past

<br/>

<br/>
Last week, we talked with Ben Donnelly about ADHD (Active Defense Harbinger Distro). But Ben isn't a one trick pony, oh no... this young punk is trying to solve fundamental problems in the business industry, in particular securing passwords.  That's why he's been working with Tim Tomes (@lanmaster53)invented 'Ball and Chain', which is a large (>2TB) file that can be used to help generate passwords and entropy.
