\*\*LEXINGTON, Mass., and RESTON, Va. – October 31, 2024\*\* \*\*–\*\* \[VulnCheck\](https://vulncheck.com/), the exploit intelligence company, and \[Carahsoft Technology Corp.\](http://www.carahsoft.com/){target=\_blank}, The Trusted Government IT Solutions Provider®, today announced a partnership. Under the agreement, Carahsoft will serve as VulnCheck’s Public Sector distributor, making \[VulnCheck for Government\](https://vulncheck.com/government)’s vulnerability, threat and exploit intelligence solutions available to the Public Sector through Carahsoft’s reseller partners and NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V and National Association of State Procurement Officials (NASPO) ValuePoint contracts. \\n \\n::author-quote\\n---\\nauthor: Jay Wallace\\nposition: Vice President of Global Sales and Customer Engineering at VulnCheck\\n---\\n\\nOur partnership with Carahsoft will significantly expand our Federal footprint, empowering some of the nation’s most critical agencies \\- both Civilian and Defense \\- with the tools needed to outpace advisories in today’s evolving threat landscape. We are thrilled to join Carahsoft’s trusted partner network to meet the Public Sector’s growing demand for next-generation vulnerability and exploit intelligence solutions.\\n::\\n\\nCyberattacks targeting the Public Sector continue to increase, with Verizon’s \[2023 Data Breach Investigations Report\](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/){target=\_blank} (DBIR) revealing that 20% of incidents and 11% of breaches analyzed this year were linked to the Public Sector, more than any other industry. Together, VulnCheck and Carahsoft will redefine how Federal security teams address the vulnerability prioritization challenge. VulnCheck delivers comprehensive, real-time vulnerability intelligence autonomously correlated with unique, proprietary exploit and threat intelligence. \\n\\n::author-quote\\n---\\nauthor: Steve Jacyna\\nposition: Director of Innovative Cybersecurity Solutions at Carahsoft\\n---\\nWe are excited to partner with VulnCheck and our reseller network to help Federal agencies identify, prioritize and remediate the vulnerabilities that matter most. As the Public Sector continues to face mounting cybersecurity threats across all aspects of operations, access to real-time assessments of exploit weaponization is critical to effectively prioritize vulnerabilities and mitigate any loss, cost or downtime that results from exploitation.\\n::\\n\\nVulnCheck’s solutions are available through Carahsoft’s SEWP V contracts \*\*NNG15SC03B\*\* and \*\*NNG15SC27B\*\* and \*\*NASPO ValuePoint Master Agreement \\#AR2472\*\*.
