# Password Perils The threat of credential stuffing exploits

<br/>

<br/>
Frank Riccardi sits down to discuss how cybercriminals exploit people’s fondness for reused passwords to launch credential stuffing attacks. Dave and Joe share a bit of follow up, one from a listener named Steve who shares some push back from the 23andMe story from last week, and the other from a listener named Michael who shares a story of unpaid toll scams. Joe shares the story of a Utah exchange student and how he fell victim to a cybersecurity kidnapping, and now authorities are trying to figure out how it happened. Dave shares a scam about tragic fake posts that lead to a "win now" website, that has been flooding his Facebook feed. Our catch of the day comes from Jon who writes in to share a suspicious email that made it through the spam filter in Google. Links to the stories: After Utah exchange student cyber kidnapping, we're looking at how the scam works Have a Catch of the Day you'd like to share? Email it to us at hackinghumans@thecyberwire.com.
